<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p>To the sacred literature of the Brahmans, in the strict sense of
the term, i.e. to the Veda, there belongs a certain number of
complementary works without whose assistance the student is,
according to Hindu notions, unable to do more than commit the
sacred texts to memory. In the first place all Vedic texts must, in
order to be understood, be read together with running commentaries
such as S&acirc;ya<i>n</i>a's commentaries on the
Sa<i>m</i>hit&acirc;s and Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>as, and the
Bh&acirc;shyas ascribed to Sa@nkara on the chief Upanishads. But
these commentaries do not by themselves conduce to a full
comprehension of the contents of the sacred texts, since they
confine themselves to explaining the meaning of each detached
passage without investigating its relation to other passages, and
the whole of which they form part; considerations of the latter
kind are at any rate introduced occasionally only. The task of
taking a comprehensive view of the contents of the Vedic writings
as a whole, of systematising what they present in an unsystematical
form, of showing the mutual co-ordination or subordination of
single passages and sections, and of reconciling
contradictions&mdash;which, according to the view of the orthodox
commentators, can be apparent only&mdash;is allotted to a separate
s&acirc;stra or body of doctrine which is termed
M&icirc;m&acirc;<i>m</i>s&acirc;, i.e. the investigation or enquiry
[Greek: kat ezochaen], viz. the enquiry into the connected meaning
of the sacred texts.</p>
<p>Of this M&icirc;m&acirc;<i>m</i>s&acirc; two branches have to be
distinguished, the so-called earlier (p&ucirc;rva)
M&icirc;m&acirc;<i>m</i>s&acirc;, and the later (uttara)
M&icirc;m&acirc;<i>m</i>s&acirc;. The former undertakes to
systematise the karmak&acirc;<i>nd</i>a, i.e. that entire portion
of the Veda which is concerned with action, pre-eminently
sacrificial action, and which comprises the Sa<i>m</i>hit&acirc;s
and the Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>as exclusive of the
&Acirc;ra<i>n</i>yaka portions; the latter performs the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-10" id=
"pageintro-10"></a>{Intro 10}</span> service with regard to the
so-called j<i>&ntilde;</i>&acirc;naka<i>nd</i>a, i.e. that part of
the Vedic writings which includes the &Acirc;ra<i>n</i>yaka
portions of the Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>as, and a number of detached
treatises called Upanishads. Its subject is not action but
knowledge, viz. the knowledge of Brahman.</p>
<p>At what period these two <i>s</i>&acirc;stras first assumed a
definite form, we are unable to ascertain. Discussions of the
nature of those which constitute the subject-matter of the
P&ucirc;rva M&icirc;m&acirc;<i>m</i>s&acirc; must have arisen at a
very early period, and the word M&icirc;m&acirc;<i>m</i>s&acirc;
itself together with its derivatives is already employed in the
Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>as to denote the doubts and discussions
connected with certain contested points of ritual. The want of a
body of definite rules prescribing how to act, i.e. how to perform
the various sacrifices in full accordance with the teaching of the
Veda, was indeed an urgent one, because it was an altogether
practical want, continually pressing itself on the adhvaryus
engaged in ritualistic duties. And the task of establishing such
rules was moreover a comparatively limited and feasible one; for
the members of a certain Vedic s&acirc;kh&acirc; or school had to
do no more than to digest thoroughly their own
br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a and sa<i>m</i>hit&acirc;, without being under
any obligation of reconciling with the teaching of their own books
the occasionally conflicting rules implied in the texts of other
s&acirc;kh&acirc;s. It was assumed that action, as being something
which depends on the will and choice of man, admits of
alternatives, so that a certain sacrifice may be performed in
different ways by members of different Vedic schools, or even by
the followers of one and the same s&acirc;kh&acirc;.</p>
<p>The Uttara M&icirc;m&acirc;<i>m</i>s&acirc;-<i>s</i>&acirc;stra
may be supposed to have originated considerably later than the
P&ucirc;rva M&icirc;m&acirc;<i>m</i>s&acirc;. In the first place,
the texts with which it is concerned doubtless constitute the
latest branch of Vedic literature. And in the second place, the
subject-matter of those texts did not call for a systematical
treatment with equal urgency, as it was in no way connected with
practice; the mental attitude of the authors of the Upanishads, who
in their lucubrations on Brahman and the soul aim at nothing less
than at definiteness and coherence, may have perpetuated itself
through <span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-11" id=
"pageintro-11"></a>{Intro 11}</span> many generations without any
great inconvenience resulting therefrom.</p>
<p>But in the long run two causes must have acted with
ever-increasing force, to give an impulse to the systematic working
up of the teaching of the Upanishads also. The followers of the
different Vedic s&acirc;kh&acirc;s no doubt recognised already at
an early period the truth that, while conflicting statements
regarding the details of a sacrifice can be got over by the
assumption of a vikalpa, i.e. an optional proceeding, it is not so
with regard to such topics as the nature of Brahman, the relation
to it of the human soul, the origin of the physical universe, and
the like. Concerning them, one opinion only can be the true one,
and it therefore becomes absolutely incumbent on those, who look on
the whole body of the Upanishads as revealed truth, to demonstrate
that their teaching forms a consistent whole free from all
contradictions. In addition there supervened the external motive
that, while the karmak&acirc;<i>nd</i>a of the Veda concerned only
the higher castes of brahmanically constituted society, on which it
enjoins certain sacrificial performances connected with certain
rewards, the j<i>&ntilde;</i>&acirc;n&acirc;k&acirc;<i>nd</i>a, as
propounding a certain theory of the world, towards which any
reflecting person inside or outside the pale of the orthodox
community could not but take up a definite position, must soon have
become the object of criticism on the part of those who held
different views on religious and philosophic things, and hence
stood in need of systematic defence.</p>
<p>At present there exists a vast literature connected with the two
branches of the M&icirc;m&acirc;<i>m</i>s&acirc;. We have, on the
one hand, all those works which constitute the P&ucirc;rva
M&icirc;m&acirc;<i>m</i>s&acirc;-<i>s</i>&acirc;stra&mdash;or as it
is often, shortly but not accurately, termed, the
M&icirc;m&acirc;<i>m</i>s&acirc;-<i>s</i>&acirc;stra&mdash;and, on
the other hand, all those works which are commonly comprised under
the name Ved&acirc;nta-<i>s</i>&acirc;stra. At the head of this
extensive literature there stand two collections of S&ucirc;tras
(i.e. short aphorisms constituting in their totality a complete
body of doctrine upon some subject), whose reputed authors are
Jainini and B&acirc;dar&acirc;ya<i>n</i>a. There can, however, be
no doubt that the composition of those two <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="pageintro-12" id="pageintro-12"></a>{Intro
12}</span> collections of S&ucirc;tras was preceded by a long
series of preparatory literary efforts of which they merely
represent the highly condensed outcome. This is rendered probable
by the analogy of other <i>s</i>&acirc;stras, as well as by the
exhaustive thoroughness with which the S&ucirc;tras perform their
task of systematizing the teaching of the Veda, and is further
proved by the frequent references which the S&ucirc;tras make to
the views of earlier teachers. If we consider merely the preserved
monuments of Indian literature, the S&ucirc;tras (of the two
M&icirc;m&acirc;<i>m</i>s&acirc;s as well as of other
<i>s</i>&acirc;stras) mark the beginning; if we, however, take into
account what once existed, although it is at present irretrievably
lost, we observe that they occupy a strictly central position,
summarising, on the one hand, a series of early literary essays
extending over many generations, and forming, on the other hand,
the head spring of an ever broadening activity of commentators as
well as virtually independent writers, which reaches down to our
days, and may yet have some future before itself.</p>
<p>The general scope of the two
M&icirc;m&acirc;<i>m</i>s&acirc;-s&ucirc;tras and their relation to
the Veda have been indicated in what precedes. A difference of some
importance between the two has, however, to be noted in this
connexion. The systematisation of the karmak&acirc;<i>nd</i>a of
the Veda led to the elaboration of two classes of works, viz. the
Kalpa-s&ucirc;tras on the one hand, and the P&ucirc;rva
M&icirc;m&acirc;<i>m</i>s&acirc;-s&ucirc;tras on the other hand.
The former give nothing but a description as concise as possible of
the sacrifices enjoined in the Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>as; while the
latter discuss and establish the general principles which the
author of a Kalpa-s&ucirc;tra has to follow, if he wishes to render
his rules strictly conformable to the teaching of the Veda. The
j<i>&ntilde;</i>&acirc;nak&acirc;<i>nd</i>a of the Veda, on the
other hand, is systematised in a single work, viz. the Uttara
M&icirc;m&acirc;<i>m</i>s&acirc; or Ved&acirc;nta-s&ucirc;tras,
which combine the two tasks of concisely stating the teaching of
the Veda, and of argumentatively establishing the special
interpretation of the Veda adopted in the S&ucirc;tras. This
difference may be accounted for by two reasons. In the first place,
the contents of the karmak&acirc;<i>nd</i>a, as being of an
entirely practical nature, called for summaries such as the
Kalpa-s&ucirc;tras, from which all burdensome discussions of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-13" id=
"pageintro-13"></a>{Intro 13}</span> method are excluded; while
there was no similar reason for the separation of the two topics in
the case of the purely theoretical science of Brahman. And, in the
second place, the Ved&acirc;nta-s&ucirc;tras throughout presuppose
the P&ucirc;rva M&icirc;m&acirc;<i>m</i>s&acirc;-s&ucirc;tras, and
may therefore dispense with the discussion of general principles
and methods already established in the latter.</p>
<p>The time at which the two
M&icirc;m&acirc;<i>m</i>s&acirc;-s&ucirc;tras were composed we are
at present unable to fix with any certainty; a few remarks on the
subject will, however, be made later on. Their outward form is that
common to all the so-called S&ucirc;tras which aims at condensing a
given body of doctrine in a number of concise aphoristic sentences,
and often even mere detached words in lieu of sentences. Besides
the M&icirc;m&acirc;<i>m</i>s&acirc;-s&ucirc;tras this literary
form is common to the fundamental works on the other philosophic
systems, on the Vedic sacrifices, on domestic ceremonies, on sacred
law, on grammar, and on metres. The two
M&icirc;m&acirc;<i>m</i>s&acirc;-s&ucirc;tras occupy, however, an
altogether exceptional position in point of style. All S&ucirc;tras
aim at conciseness; that is clearly the reason to which this whole
species of literary composition owes its existence. This their aim
they reach by the rigid exclusion of all words which can possibly
be spared, by the careful avoidance of all unnecessary repetitions,
and, as in the case of the grammatical S&ucirc;tras, by the
employment of an arbitrarily coined terminology which substitutes
single syllables for entire words or combination of words. At the
same time the manifest intention of the S&ucirc;tra writers is to
express themselves with as much clearness as the conciseness
affected by them admits of. The aphorisms are indeed often concise
to excess, but not otherwise intrinsically obscure, the manifest
care of the writers being to retain what is essential in a given
phrase, and to sacrifice only what can be supplied, although
perhaps not without difficulty, and an irksome strain of memory and
reflection. Hence the possibility of understanding without a
commentary a very considerable portion at any rate of the ordinary
S&ucirc;tras. Altogether different is the case of the two
M&icirc;m&acirc;<i>m</i>s&acirc;-s&ucirc;tras. There scarcely one
single S&ucirc;tra is <span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-14"
id="pageintro-14"></a>{Intro 14}</span> intelligible without a
commentary. The most essential words are habitually dispensed with;
nothing is, for instance, more common than the simple ommission of
the subject or predicate of a sentence. And when here and there a
S&ucirc;tra occurs whose words construe without anything having to
be supplied, the phraseology is so eminently vague and obscure that
without the help derived from a commentary we should be unable to
make out to what subject the S&ucirc;tra refers. When undertaking
to translate either of the
M&icirc;m&acirc;<i>m</i>s&acirc;-s&ucirc;tras we therefore depend
altogether on commentaries; and hence the question arises which of
the numerous commentaries extant is to be accepted as a guide to
their right understanding.</p>
<p>The commentary here selected for translation, together with
B&acirc;dar&acirc;ya<i>n</i>a's S&ucirc;tras (to which we shall
henceforth confine our attention to the exclusion of Jaimini's
P&ucirc;rva M&icirc;m&acirc;<i>m</i>s&acirc;-s&ucirc;tras), is the
one composed by the celebrated theologian <i>S</i>a@nkara or, as he
is commonly called, <i>S</i>a@nkar&acirc;<i>k</i>&acirc;rya. There
are obvious reasons for this selection. In the first place, the
<i>S</i>a@nkara-bh&acirc;shya represents the so-called orthodox
side of Brahminical theology which strictly upholds the Brahman or
highest Self of the Upanishads as something different from, and in
fact immensely superior to, the divine beings such as Vish<i>n</i>u
or Siva, which, for many centuries, have been the chief objects of
popular worship in India. In the second place, the doctrine
advocated by <i>S</i>a@nkara is, from a purely philosophical point
of view and apart from all theological considerations, the most
important and interesting one which has arisen on Indian soil;
neither those forms of the Ved&acirc;nta which diverge from the
view represented by <i>S</i>a@nkara nor any of the
non-Ved&acirc;ntic systems can be compared with the so-called
orthodox Ved&acirc;nta in boldness, depth, and subtlety of
speculation. In the third place, <i>S</i>a@nkara's bh&acirc;ashya
is, as far as we know, the oldest of the extant commentaries, and
relative antiquity is at any rate one of the circumstances which
have to be <span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-15" id=
"pageintro-15"></a>{Intro 15}</span> taken into account, although,
it must be admitted, too much weight may easily be attached to it.
The <i>S</i>a@nkara-bh&acirc;shya further is the authority most
generally deferred to in India as to the right understanding of the
Ved&acirc;nta-s&ucirc;tras, and ever since <i>S</i>a@nkara's time
the majority of the best thinkers of India have been men belonging
to his school. If in addition to all this we take into
consideration the intrinsic merits of <i>S</i>a@nkara's work which,
as a piece of philosophical argumentation and theological
apologetics, undoubtedly occupies a high rank, the preference here
given to it will be easily understood.</p>
<p>But to the European&mdash;or, generally, modern&mdash;translator
of the Ved&acirc;nta-s&ucirc;tras with <i>S</i>a@nkara's commentary
another question will of course suggest itself at once, viz.
whether or not <i>S</i>a@nkara's explanations faithfully render the
intended meaning of the author of the S&ucirc;tras. To the Indian
Pandit of <i>S</i>a@nkara's school this question has become an
indifferent one, or, to state the case more accurately, he objects
to it being raised, as he looks on <i>S</i>a@nkara's authority as
standing above doubt and dispute. When pressed to make good his
position he will, moreover, most probably not enter into any
detailed comparison of <i>S</i>a@nkara's comments with the text of
B&acirc;dar&acirc;ya<i>n</i>a's S&ucirc;tras, but will rather
endeavour to show on speculative grounds that <i>S</i>a@nkara's
philosophical view is the only true one, whence it of course
follows that it accurately represents the meaning of
B&acirc;dar&acirc;ya<i>n</i>a, who himself must necessarily be
assured to have taught the true doctrine. But on the modern
investigator, who neither can consider himself bound by the
authority of a name however great, nor is likely to look to any
Indian system of thought for the satisfaction of his speculative
wants, it is clearly incumbent not to acquiesce from the outset in
the interpretations given of the
Ved&acirc;nta-s&ucirc;tras&mdash;and the Upanishads&mdash;by
<i>S</i>a@nkara and his school, but to submit them, as far as that
can be done, to a critical investigation.</p>
<p>This is a task which would have to be undertaken even if
<i>S</i>a@nkara's views as to the true meaning of the S&ucirc;tras
and Upanishads had never been called into doubt on Indian soil,
although in that case it could perhaps hardly be entered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-16" id=
"pageintro-16"></a>{Intro 16}</span> upon with much hope of
success; but it becomes much more urgent, and at the same time more
feasible, when we meet in India itself with systems claiming to be
Ved&acirc;ntic and based on interpretations of the S&ucirc;tras and
Upanishads more or less differing from those of <i>S</i>a@nkara.
The claims of those systems to be in the possession of the right
understanding of the fundamental authorities of the Ved&acirc;nta
must at any rate be examined, even if we should finally be
compelled to reject them.</p>
<p>It appears that already at a very early period the
Ved&acirc;nta-s&ucirc;tras had come to be looked upon as an
authoritative work, not to be neglected by any who wished to
affiliate their own doctrines to the Veda. At present, at any rate,
there are very few Hindu sects not interested in showing that their
distinctive tenets are countenanced by
B&acirc;dar&acirc;ya<i>n</i>a's teaching. Owing to this the
commentaries on the S&ucirc;tras have in the course of time become
very numerous, and it is at present impossible to give a full and
accurate enumeration even of those actually existing, much less of
those referred to and quoted. Mr. Fitz-Edward Hall, in his
Bibliographical Index, mentions fourteen commentaries, copies of
which had been inspected by himself. Some among these (as, for
instance, R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja's Ved&acirc;nta-s&acirc;ra, No.
XXXV) are indeed not commentaries in the strict sense of the word,
but rather systematic expositions of the doctrine supposed to be
propounded in the S&ucirc;tras; but, on the other hand, there are
in existence several true commentaries which had not been
accessible to Fitz-Edward Hall. It would hardly be
practical&mdash;and certainly not feasible in this place&mdash;to
submit all the existing bh&acirc;shyas to a critical enquiry at
once. All we can do here is to single out one or a few of the more
important ones, and to compare their interpretations with those
given by <i>S</i>a@nkara, and with the text of the S&ucirc;tras
themselves.</p>
<p>The bh&acirc;shya, which in this connexion is the first to press
itself upon our attention, is the one composed by the famous
Vaish@nava theologian and philosopher R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja, who is
supposed to have lived in the twelfth century. The
R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja or, as it is often called, the
<i>S</i>r&icirc;-bh&acirc;shya appears to be <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="pageintro-17" id="pageintro-17"></a>{Intro
17}</span> the oldest commentary extant next to <i>S</i>a@nkara's.
It is further to be noted that the sect of the
R&acirc;m&acirc;nujas occupies a pre-eminent position among the
Vaishnava, sects which themselves, in their totality, may claim to
be considered the most important among all Hindu sects. The
intrinsic value of the <i>S</i>r&icirc;-bh&acirc;shya moreover
is&mdash;as every student acquainted with it will be ready to
acknowledge&mdash;a very high one; it strikes one throughout as a
very solid performance due to a writer of extensive learning and
great power of argumentation, and in its polemic parts, directed
chiefly against the school of <i>S</i>a@nkara, it not unfrequently
deserves to be called brilliant even. And in addition to all this
it shows evident traces of being not the mere outcome of
R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja's individual views, but of resting on an old
and weighty tradition.</p>
<p>This latter point is clearly of the greatest importance. If it
could be demonstrated or even rendered probable only that the
oldest bh&acirc;shya which we possess, i.e. the
<i>S</i>a@nkara-bh&acirc;shya, represents an uninterrupted and
uniform tradition bridging over the interval between
B&acirc;dar&acirc;ya<i>n</i>a, the reputed author of the
S&ucirc;tras, and <i>S</i>a@nkara; and if, on the other hand, it
could be shown that the more modern bh&acirc;shyas are not
supported by old tradition, but are nothing more than bold attempts
of clever sectarians to force an old work of generally recognised
authority into the service of their individual tenets; there would
certainly be no reason for us to raise the question whether the
later bh&acirc;shyas can help us in making out the true meaning of
the S&ucirc;tras. All we should have to do in that case would be to
accept <i>S</i>a@nkara's interpretations as they stand, or at the
utmost to attempt to make out, if at all possible, by a careful
comparison of <i>S</i>a@nkara's bh&acirc;shya with the text of the
S&ucirc;tras, whether the former in all cases faithfully represents
the purport of the latter.</p>
<p>In the most recent book of note which at all enters into the
question as to how far we have to accept <i>S</i>a@nkara as a guide
to the right understanding of the S&ucirc;tras (Mr. A. Gough's
Philosophy of the Upanishads) the view is maintained (pp. 239 ff.)
that <i>S</i>a@nkara is the generally recognised expositor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-18" id=
"pageintro-18"></a>{Intro 18}</span> of true Ved&acirc;nta
doctrine, that that doctrine was handed down by an unbroken series
of teachers intervening between him and the S&ucirc;trak&acirc;ra,
and that there existed from the beginning only one Ved&acirc;nta
doctrine, agreeing in all essential points with the doctrine known
to us from <i>S</i>a@nkara's writings. Mr. Gough undertakes to
prove this view, firstly, by a comparison of <i>S</i>a@nkara's
system with the teaching of the Upanishads themselves; and,
secondly, by a comparison of the purport of the
S&ucirc;tras&mdash;as far as that can be made out independently of
the commentaries&mdash;with the interpretations given of them by
<i>S</i>a@nkara. To both these points we shall revert later on.
Meanwhile, I only wish to remark concerning the former point that,
even if we could show with certainty that all the Upanishads
propound one and the same doctrine, there yet remains the
undeniable fact of our being confronted by a considerable number of
essentially differing theories, all of which claim to be founded on
the Upanishads. And with regard to the latter point I have to say
for the present that, as long as we have only <i>S</i>a@nkara's
bh&acirc;shya before us, we are naturally inclined to find in the
S&ucirc;tras&mdash;which, taken by themselves, are for the greater
part unintelligible&mdash;the meaning which <i>S</i>a@nkara
ascribes to them; while a reference to other bh&acirc;shyas may not
impossibly change our views at once.&mdash;Meanwhile, we will
consider the question as to the unbroken uniformity of
Ved&acirc;ntic tradition from another point or view, viz. by
enquiring whether or not the S&ucirc;tras themselves, and the
<i>S</i>a@nkara-bh&acirc;shya, furnish any indications of there
having existed already at an early time essentially different
Ved&acirc;ntic systems or lines of Ved&acirc;ntic speculation.</p>
<p>Beginning with the S&ucirc;tras, we find that they supply ample
evidence to the effect that already at a very early time, viz. the
period antecedent to the final composition of the
Ved&acirc;nta-s&ucirc;tras in their present shape, there had arisen
among the chief doctors of the Ved&acirc;nta differences of
opinion, bearing not only upon minor points of doctrine, but
affecting the most essential parts of the system. In addition to
B&acirc;dar&acirc;ya<i>n</i>a himself, the reputed author of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-19" id=
"pageintro-19"></a>{Intro 19}</span> S&ucirc;tras, the latter quote
opinions ascribed to the following teachers: &Acirc;treya,
&Acirc;<i>s</i>marathya, Au<i>d</i>ulomi,
K&acirc;rsh<i>n</i>&acirc;gini, K&acirc;<i>s</i>ak<i>ri</i>tsna,
Jaimini, B&acirc;dari. Among the passages where diverging views of
those teachers are recorded and contrasted three are of particular
importance. Firstly, a passage in the fourth p&acirc;da of the
fourth adhy&acirc;ya (S&ucirc;tras 5-7), where the opinions of
various teachers concerning the characteristics of the released
soul are given, and where the important discrepancy is noted that,
according to Au<i>d</i>ulomi, its only characteristic is thought
(<i>k</i>aitanya), while Jaimini maintains that it possesses a
number of exalted qualities, and B&acirc;dar&acirc;ya<i>n</i>a
declares himself in favour of a combination of those two
views.&mdash;The second passage occurs in the third p&acirc;da of
the fourth adhy&acirc;ya (S&ucirc;tras 7-14), where Jaimini
maintains that the soul of him who possesses the lower knowledge of
Brahman goes after death to the highest Brahman, while
B&acirc;dari&mdash;whose opinion is endorsed by
<i>S</i>a@nkara&mdash;teaches that it repairs to the lower Brahman
only&mdash;Finally, the third and most important passage is met
with in the fourth p&acirc;da of the first adhy&acirc;ya
(S&ucirc;tras 20-22), where the question is discussed why in a
certain passage of the Brhad&acirc;ra<i>n</i>yaka Brahman is
referred to in terms which are strictly applicable to the
individual soul only. In connexion therewith the S&ucirc;tras quote
the views of three ancient teachers about the relation in which the
individual soul stands to Brahman. According to
&Acirc;<i>s</i>marathya (if we accept the interpretation of his
view given by <i>S</i>a@nkara and <i>S</i>a@nkara's commentators)
the soul stands to Brahman in the bhed&acirc;bheda relation, i.e.
it is neither absolutely different nor absolutely non-different
from it, as sparks are from fire. Audulomi, on the other hand,
teaches that the soul is altogether different from Brahman up to
the time when obtaining final release it is merged in it, and
K&acirc;<i>s</i>ak<i>ri</i>tsna finally upholds the doctrine that
the soul is absolutely non-different from Brahman; which, in, some
way or other presents itself as the individual soul.</p>
<p>That the ancient teachers, the ripest outcome of whose
speculations and discussions is embodied in the
Ved&acirc;nta-s&ucirc;tras, disagreed among themselves on points of
vital <span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-20" id=
"pageintro-20"></a>{Intro 20}</span> importance is sufficiently
proved by the three passages quoted. The one quoted last is
specially significant as showing that recognised
authorities&mdash;deemed worthy of being quoted in the
S&ucirc;tras&mdash;denied that doctrine on which the whole system
of <i>S</i>a@nkara hinges, viz. the doctrine of the absolute
identity of the individual soul with Brahman.</p>
<p>Turning next to the <i>S</i>a@nkara-bh&acirc;shya itself, we
there also meet with indications that the Ved&acirc;ntins were
divided among themselves on important points of dogma. These
indications are indeed not numerous: <i>S</i>a@nkara, does not on
the whole impress one as an author particularly anxious to
strengthen his own case by appeals to ancient authorities, a
peculiarity of his which later writers of hostile tendencies have
not failed to remark and criticise. But yet more than once
<i>S</i>a@nkara also refers to the opinion of 'another,' viz.,
commentator of the S&ucirc;tras, and in several places
<i>S</i>a@nkara's commentators explain that the 'other' meant is
the V<i>ri</i>ttik&acirc;ra (about whom more will be said shortly).
Those references as a rule concern minor points of exegesis, and
hence throw little or no light on important differences of dogma;
but there are two remarks of <i>S</i>a@nkara's at any rate which
are of interest in this connexion. The one is made with reference
to S&ucirc;tras 7-14 of the third p&acirc;da of the fourth
adhy&acirc;ya; 'some,' he says there, 'declare those S&ucirc;tras,
which I look upon as setting forth the siddh&acirc;nta view, to
state merely the p&ucirc;rvapaksha;' a difference of opinion which,
as we have seen above, affects the important question as to the
ultimate fate of those who have not reached the knowledge of the
highest Brahman.&mdash;And under I, 3, 19 <i>S</i>a@nkara, after
having explained at length that the individual soul as such cannot
claim any reality, but is real only in so far as it is identical
with Brahman, adds the following words, 'apare tu
v&acirc;dina<i>h</i> p&acirc;ram&acirc;rthikam eva jaiva<i>m</i>
r&ucirc;pam iti manyante asmad&icirc;y&acirc;<i>s</i> <i>k</i>a
ke<i>k</i>it,' i.e. other theorisers again, and among them some of
ours, are of opinion that the individual soul as such is real.' The
term 'ours,' here made use of, can denote only the Aupanishadas or
Ved&acirc;ntins, and it thus appears that <i>S</i>a@nkara himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-21" id=
"pageintro-21"></a>{Intro 21}</span> was willing to class under the
same category himself and philosophers who&mdash;as in later times
the R&acirc;m&acirc;nujas and others&mdash;looked upon the
individual soul as not due to the fictitious limitations of
M&acirc;y&acirc;, but as real in itself; whatever may be the
relation in which they considered it to stand to the highest
Self.</p>
<p>From what precedes it follows that the Ved&acirc;ntins of the
school to which <i>S</i>a@nkara himself belonged acknowledged the
existence of Ved&acirc;ntic teaching of a type essentially
different from their own. We must now proceed to enquire whether
the R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja system, which likewise claims to be
Ved&acirc;nta, and to be founded on the Ved&acirc;nta-s&ucirc;tras,
has any title to be considered an ancient system and the heir of a
respectable tradition.</p>
<p>It appears that R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja claims&mdash;and by Hindu
writers is generally admitted&mdash;to follow in his bh&acirc;shya
the authority of Bodh&acirc;yana, who had composed a v<i>ri</i>tti
on the S&ucirc;tras. Thus we read in the beginning of the
<i>S</i>r&icirc;-bh&acirc;shya (Pandit, New Series, VII, p. 163),
'Bhagavad-bodh&acirc;yanak<i>ri</i>t&acirc;<i>m</i>
vist&icirc;rn&acirc;<i>m</i>
brahmas&ucirc;tra-v<i>ri</i>tti<i>m</i>
p&ucirc;rv&acirc;<i>k</i>&acirc;ry&acirc;<i>h</i>
sa<i>m</i>kikshipus tanmat&acirc;nus&acirc;re<i>n</i>a
s&ucirc;tr&acirc;kshar&acirc;<i>n</i>i vy&acirc;khy&acirc;syante.'
Whether the Bodh&acirc;yana to whom that v<i>ri</i>tti is ascribed
is to be identified with the author of the Kalpa-s&ucirc;tra, and
other works, cannot at present be decided. But that an ancient
v<i>ri</i>tti on the S&ucirc;tras connected with Bodh&acirc;yana's
name actually existed, there is not any reason to doubt. Short
quotations from it are met with in a few places of the
<i>S</i>r&icirc;-bh&acirc;shya, and, as we have seen above,
<i>S</i>a@nkara's commentators state that their author's polemical
remarks are directed against the V<i>ri</i>ttik&acirc;ra. In
addition to Bodh&acirc;yana, R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja appeals to quite
a series of ancient
teachers&mdash;p&ucirc;rv&acirc;<i>k</i>&acirc;ry&acirc;s&mdash;who
carried on the true tradition as to the teaching of the
Ved&acirc;nta and the meaning of the S&ucirc;tras. In the
Ved&acirc;rthasa@ngraha&mdash;a work composed by
R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja himself&mdash;we meet in one place with the
enumeration of the following authorities: Bodh&acirc;yana,
<i>T</i>a@nka, Drami<i>d</i>a, Guhadeva, Kapardin, Bharu<i>k</i>i,
and quotations from the writings of some of these are not
unfrequent in the Ved&acirc;rthasa@ngraha, as well as the
<i>S</i>r&icirc;-bh&acirc;shya. <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"pageintro-22" id="pageintro-22"></a>{Intro 22}</span> The author
most frequently quoted is Drami<i>d</i>a, who composed the
Drami<i>d</i>a-bh&acirc;shya; he is sometimes referred to as the
bh&acirc;shyak&acirc;ra. Another writer repeatedly quoted as the
v&acirc;kyak&acirc;ra is, I am told, to be identified with the
<i>T</i>a@nka mentioned above. I refrain from inserting in this
place the information concerning the relative age of these writers
which may be derived from the oral tradition of the
R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja sect. From another source, however, we receive
an intimation that Drami<i>d</i>&acirc;<i>k</i>&acirc;rya or
Dravi<i>d</i>&acirc;<i>k</i>&acirc;rya preceded <i>S</i>a@nkara in
point of time. In his <i>t</i>&icirc;k&acirc; on <i>S</i>a@nkara's
bh&acirc;shya to the Ch&acirc;ndogya Upanishad III, 10, 4,
&Acirc;nandagiri remarks that the attempt made by his author to
reconcile the cosmological views of the Upanishad with the teaching
of Sm<i>ri</i>ti on the same point is a reproduction of the
analogous attempt made by the
Dravi<i>d</i>&acirc;<i>k</i>&acirc;rya.</p>
<p>It thus appears that that special interpretation of the
Ved&acirc;nta-s&ucirc;tras with which the
<i>S</i>r&icirc;-bh&acirc;shya makes us acquainted is not due to
innovating views on the part of R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja, but had
authoritative representatives already at a period anterior to that
of <i>S</i>a@nkara. This latter point, moreover, receives
additional confirmation from the relation in which the so-called
R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja sect stands to earlier sects. What the exact
position of R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja was, and of what nature were the
reforms that rendered him so prominent as to give his name to a new
sect, is not exactly known at present; at the same time it is
generally acknowledged that the R&acirc;m&acirc;nujas are closely
connected with the so-called Bh&acirc;gavatas or
P&acirc;<i>&ntilde;k</i>ar&acirc;tras, who are known to have
existed already at a very early time. This latter point is proved
by evidence of various kinds; for our present purpose it suffices
to point to the fact that, according to the interpretation of the
most authoritative commentators, the last <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="pageintro-23" id="pageintro-23"></a>{Intro
23}</span> S&ucirc;tras of the second p&acirc;da of the second
adhy&acirc;ya (Ved&acirc;nta-s&ucirc;tras) refer to a distinctive
tenet of the Bh&acirc;gavatas&mdash;which tenet forms part of the
R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja system also&mdash;viz. that the highest being
manifests itself in a fourfold form (vy&ucirc;ha) as
V&acirc;sudeva, Sa@nkarsha<i>n</i>a, Pradyumna, Aniruddha, those
four forms being identical with the highest Self, the individual
soul, the internal organ (manas), and the principle of egoity
(aha@nk&acirc;ra). Whether those S&ucirc;tras embody an approval of
the tenet referred to, as R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja maintains, or are
meant to impugn it, as <i>S</i>a@nkara thinks; so much is certain
that in the opinion of the best commentators the Bh&acirc;gavatas,
the direct forerunners of the R&acirc;m&acirc;nujas, are mentioned
in the S&ucirc;tras themselves, and hence must not only have
existed, but even reached a considerable degree of importance at
the time when the S&ucirc;tras were composed. And considering the
general agreement of the systems of the earlier Bh&acirc;gavatas
and the later R&acirc;m&acirc;nujas, we have a full right to
suppose that the two sects were at one also in their mode of
interpreting the Ved&acirc;nta-s&ucirc;tras.</p>
<p>The preceding considerations suffice, I am inclined to think, to
show that it will by no means be wasted labour to enquire how
R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja interprets the S&ucirc;tras, and wherein he
differs from <i>S</i>a@nkara. This in fact seems clearly to be the
first step we have to take, if we wish to make an attempt at least
of advancing beyond the interpretations of scholiasts to the
meaning of the S&ucirc;tras themselves. A full and exhaustive
comparison of the views of the two commentators would indeed far
exceed the limits of the space which can here he devoted to that
task, and will, moreover, be made with greater ease and advantage
when the complete Sanskrit text of the
<i>S</i>r&icirc;-bh&acirc;shya has been printed, and thus made
available for general reference. But meanwhile it is possible,
and&mdash;as said before&mdash;even urged upon a translator of the
S&ucirc;tras to compare the interpretations, given by the two
bh&acirc;shyak&acirc;ras, of those S&ucirc;tras, which, more than
others, touch on the essential points of the Ved&acirc;nta system.
This <span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-24" id=
"pageintro-24"></a>{Intro 24}</span> will best be done in connexion
with a succinct but full review of the topics discussed in the
adhikara<i>n</i>as of the Ved&acirc;nta-s&ucirc;tras, according to
<i>S</i>a@nkara; a review which&mdash;apart from the side-glances
at R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja's comments&mdash;will be useful as a guide
through the S&ucirc;tras and the <i>S</i>a@nkara-bh&acirc;shya.
Before, however, entering on that task, I think it advisable to
insert short sketches of the philosophical systems of
<i>S</i>a@nkara as well as of R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja, which may be
referred to when, later on discrepancies between the two
commentators will be noted. In these sketches I shall confine
myself to the leading features, and not enter into any details. Of
<i>S</i>a@nkara's system we possess as it is more than one
trustworthy exposition; it may suffice to refer to Deussen's System
of the Ved&acirc;nta, in which the details of the entire system, as
far as they can be learned from the S&ucirc;tra-bh&acirc;shya, are
represented fully and faithfully, and to Gough's Philosophy of the
Upanishads which, principally in its second chapter, gives a lucid
sketch of the <i>S</i>a@nkara Ved&acirc;nta, founded on the
S&ucirc;tra-bh&acirc;shya, the Upanishad bh&acirc;shyas, and some
later writers belonging to <i>S</i>a@nkara's school. With regard to
R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja's philosophy our chief source was, hitherto,
the R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja chapter in the
Sarvadar<i>s</i>a<i>n</i>asa<i>m</i>graha; the short sketch about
to be given is founded altogether on the
<i>S</i>r&icirc;-bh&acirc;shya itself.</p>
<p>What in <i>S</i>a@nkara's opinion the Upanishads teach, is
shortly as follows.&mdash;Whatever is, is in reality one; there
truly exists only one universal being called Brahman or
Param&acirc;tman, the highest Self. This being is of an absolutely
homogeneous nature; it is pure 'Being,' or, which comes to the
same, pure intelligence or thought (<i>k</i>aitanya, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="pageintro-25" id="pageintro-25"></a>{Intro
25}</span> j<i>&ntilde;</i>&acirc;na). Intelligence or thought is
not to be predicated of Brahman as its attribute, but constitutes
its substance, Brahman is not a thinking being, but thought itself.
It is absolutely destitute of qualities; whatever qualities or
attributes are conceivable, can only be denied of it.&mdash;But, if
nothing exists but one absolutely simple being, whence the
appearance of the world by which we see ourselves surrounded, and,
in which we ourselves exist as individual beings?&mdash;Brahman,
the answer runs, is associated with a certain power called
M&acirc;y&acirc; or avidy&acirc; to which the appearance of this
entire world is due. This power cannot be called 'being' (sat), for
'being' is only Brahman; nor can it be called 'non-being' (asat) in
the strict sense, for it at any rate produces the appearance of
this world. It is in fact a principle of illusion; the undefinable
cause owing to which there seems to exist a material world
comprehending distinct individual existences. Being associated with
this principle of illusion, Brahman is enabled to project the
appearance of the world, in the same way as a magician is enabled
by his incomprehensible magical power to produce illusory
appearances of animate and inanimate beings. M&acirc;y&acirc; thus
constitutes the up&acirc;d&acirc;na, the material cause of the
world; or&mdash;if we wish to call attention to the circumstance
that M&acirc;y&acirc; belongs to Brahman as a <i>s</i>akti&mdash;we
may say that the material cause of the world is Brahman in so far
as it is associated with M&acirc;y&acirc;. In this latter quality
Brahman is more properly called &Icirc;<i>s</i>vara, the Lord.</p>
<p>M&acirc;y&acirc;, under the guidance of the Lord, modifies
itself by a progressive evolution into all the individual
existences (bheda), distinguished by special names and forms, of
which the world consists; from it there spring in due succession
the different material elements and the whole bodily apparatus
belonging to sentient Beings. In all those apparently, individual
forms of existence the one indivisible Brahman is present, but,
owing to the particular adjuncts into which M&acirc;y&acirc; has
specialised itself, it appears to be broken up&mdash;it is broken
up, as it were&mdash;into a multiplicity, of intellectual or
sentient principles, the so-called j&icirc;vas (individual or
personal souls). What is real in each <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="pageintro-26" id="pageintro-26"></a>{Intro
26}</span> j&icirc;va is only the universal Brahman itself; the
whole aggregate of individualising bodily organs and mental
functions, which in our ordinary experience separate and
distinguish one j&icirc;va from another, is the offspring of
M&acirc;y&acirc; and as such unreal.</p>
<p>The phenomenal world or world of ordinary experience
(vyavah&acirc;ra) thus consists of a number of individual souls
engaged in specific cognitions, volitions, and so on, and of the
external material objects with which those cognitions and volitions
are concerned. Neither the specific cognitions nor their objects
are real in the true sense of the word, for both are altogether due
to M&acirc;y&acirc;. But at the same time we have to reject the
idealistic doctrine of certain Bauddha schools according to which
nothing whatever truly exists, but certain trains of cognitional
acts or ideas to which no external objects correspond; for external
things, although not real in the strict sense of the word, enjoy at
any rate as much reality as the specific cognitional acts whose
objects they are.</p>
<p>The non-enlightened soul is unable to look through and beyond
M&acirc;y&acirc;, which, like a veil, hides from it its true
nature. Instead of recognising itself to be Brahman, it blindly
identifies itself with its adjuncts (up&acirc;dhi), the fictitious
offspring of M&acirc;y&acirc;, and thus looks for its true Self in
the body, the sense organs, and the internal organ (manas), i.e.
the organ of specific cognition. The soul, which in reality is pure
intelligence, non-active, infinite, thus becomes limited in extent,
as it were, limited in knowledge and power, an agent and enjoyer.
Through its actions it burdens itself with merit and demerit, the
consequences of which it has to bear or enjoy in series of future
embodied existences, the Lord&mdash;as a retributor and
dispenser&mdash;allotting to each soul that form of embodiment to
which it is entitled by its previous actions. At the end of each of
the great world periods called kalpas the Lord retracts the whole
world, i.e. the whole material world is dissolved and merged into
non-distinct M&acirc;y&acirc;, while the individual souls, free for
the time from actual connexion with up&acirc;dhis, lie in deep
slumber as it were. But as the <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"pageintro-27" id="pageintro-27"></a>{Intro 27}</span> consequences
of their former deeds are not yet exhausted, they have again to
enter on embodied existence as soon as the Lord sends forth a new
material world, and the old round of birth, action, death begins
anew to last to all eternity as it has lasted from all
eternity.</p>
<p>The means of escaping from this endless sa<i>ms</i>&aacute;ra,
the way out of which can never be found by the non-enlightened
soul, are furnished by the Veda. The karmak&aacute;<i>nd</i>a
indeed, whose purport it is to enjoin certain actions, cannot lead
to final release; for even the most meritorious works necessarily
lead to new forms of embodied existence. And in the
j<i>&ntilde;</i>&acirc;nak&acirc;<i>nd</i>a of the Veda also two
different parts have to be distinguished, viz., firstly, those
chapters and passages which treat of Brahman in so far as related
to the world, and hence characterised by various attributes, i.e.
of &Icirc;<i>s</i>vara or the lower Brahman; and, secondly, those
texts which set forth the nature of the highest Brahman
transcending all qualities, and the fundamental identity of the
individual soul with that highest Brahman. Devout meditation on
Brahman as suggested by passages of the former kind does not
directly lead to final emancipation; the pious worshipper passes on
his death into the world of the lower Brahman only, where he
continues to exist as a distinct individual soul&mdash;although in
the enjoyment of great power and knowledge&mdash;until at last he
reaches the highest knowledge, and, through it, final
release.&mdash;That student of the Veda, on the other hand, whose
soul has been enlightened by the texts embodying the higher
knowledge of Brahman, whom passages such as the great saying, 'That
art thou,' have taught that there is no difference between his true
Self and the highest Self, obtains at the moment of death immediate
final release, i.e. he withdraws altogether from the influence of
M&acirc;y&acirc;, and asserts himself in his true nature, which is
nothing else but the absolute highest Brahman.</p>
<p>Thus <i>S</i>a@nkara.&mdash;According to R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja,
on the other hand, the teaching of the Upanishads has to be
summarised as follows.&mdash;There exists only one all-embracing
being called Brahman or the highest Self of the Lord. This being is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-28" id=
"pageintro-28"></a>{Intro 28}</span> not destitute of attributes,
but rather endowed with all imaginable auspicious qualities. It is
not 'intelligence,'&mdash;as <i>S</i>a@nkara maintains,&mdash;but
intelligence is its chief attribute. The Lord is all-pervading,
all-powerful, all-knowing, all-merciful; his nature is
fundamentally antagonistic to all evil. He contains within himself
whatever exists. While, according to <i>S</i>a@nkara, the only
reality is to be found in the non-qualified homogeneous highest
Brahman which can only be defined as pure 'Being' or pure thought,
all plurality being a mere illusion; Brahman&mdash;according to
R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja's view&mdash;comprises within itself distinct
elements of plurality which all of them lay claim to absolute
reality of one and the same kind. Whatever is presented to us by
ordinary experience, viz. matter in all its various modifications
and the individual souls of different classes and degrees, are
essential real constituents of Brahman's nature. Matter and souls
(a<i>k</i>it and <i>k</i>it) constitute, according to
R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja's terminology, the body of the Lord; they
stand to him in the same relation of entire dependence and
subserviency in which the matter forming an animal or vegetable
body stands to its soul or animating principle. The Lord pervades
and rules all things which exist&mdash;material or
immaterial&mdash;as their antary&acirc;min; the fundamental text
for this special R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja tenet&mdash;which in the
writings of the sect is quoted again and again&mdash;is the
so-called antary&acirc;min br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a. (B<i>ri</i>. Up.
III, 7) which says, that within all elements, all sense organs,
and, lastly, within all individual souls, there abides an inward
ruler whose body those elements, sense-organs, and individual souls
constitute.&mdash;Matter and souls as forming the body of the Lord
are also called modes of him (prak&acirc;ra). They are to be looked
upon as his effects, but they have enjoyed the kind of individual
existence which is theirs from all eternity, and will never be
entirely resolved into Brahman. They, however, exist in two
different, periodically alternating, conditions. At some times they
exist in a subtle state in which they do not possess those
qualities by which they are ordinarily known, and there is then no
distinction of individual name and form. Matter in that state is
unevolved (avyakta); the <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"pageintro-29" id="pageintro-29"></a>{Intro 29}</span> individual
souls are not joined to material bodies, and their intelligence is
in a state of contraction, non-manifestation (sa@nko<i>k</i>a).
This is the pralaya state which recurs at the end of each kalpa,
and Brahman is then said to be in its causal condition
(k&acirc;ra<i>n</i>&acirc;vasth&acirc;). To that state all those
scriptural passages refer which speak of Brahman or the Self as
being in the beginning one only, without a second. Brahman then is
indeed not absolutely one, for it contains within itself matter and
souls in a germinal condition; but as in that condition they are so
subtle as not to allow of individual distinctions being made, they
are not counted as something second in addition to
Brahman.&mdash;When the pralaya state comes to an end, creation
takes place owing to an act of volition on the Lord's part. Primary
unevolved matter then passes over into its other condition; it
becomes gross and thus acquires all those sensible attributes,
visibility, tangibility, and so on, which are known from ordinary
experience. At the same time the souls enter into connexion with
material bodies corresponding to the degree of merit or demerit
acquired by them in previous forms of existence; their intelligence
at the same time undergoes a certain expansion
(vik&acirc;<i>s</i>a). The Lord, together with matter in its gross
state and the 'expanded' souls, is Brahman in the condition of an
effect (k&aacute;ry&acirc;vasth&acirc;). Cause and effect are thus
at the bottom the same; for the effect is nothing but the cause
which has undergone a certain change (pari<i>n</i>&acirc;ma). Hence
the cause being known, the effect is known likewise.</p>
<p>Owing to the effects of their former actions the individual
souls are implicated in the sa<i>m</i>s&acirc;ra, the endless cycle
of birth, action, and death, final escape from which is to be
obtained only through the study of the
j<i>&ntilde;</i>&acirc;nak&acirc;<i>nd</i>a of the Veda. Compliance
with the injunctions of the karmak&acirc;<i>nd</i>a does not lead
outside the sa<i>m</i>s&acirc;ra; but he who, assisted by the grace
of the Lord, cognizes&mdash;and meditates on&mdash;him in the way
prescribed by the Upanishads reaches at his death final
emancipation, i.e. he passes through the different stages of the
path of the gods up to the world of Brahman and there enjoys an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-30" id=
"pageintro-30"></a>{Intro 30}</span> everlasting blissful existence
from which there is no return into the sphere of transmigration.
The characteristics of the released soul are similar to those of
Brahman; it participates in all the latter's glorious qualities and
powers, excepting only Brahman's power to emit, rule, and retract
the entire world.</p>
<p>The chief points in which the two systems sketched above agree
on the one hand and diverge on the other may be shortly stated as
follows.&mdash;Both systems teach advaita, i.e. non-duality or
monism. There exist not several fundamentally distinct principles,
such as the prak<i>r</i>iti and the purushas of the
S&acirc;@nkhyas, but there exists only one all-embracing being.
While, however, the advaita taught by <i>S</i>a@nkara is a
rigorous, absolute one, R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja's doctrine has to be
characterised as visish<i>t</i>a advaita, i.e. qualified
non-duality, non-duality with a difference. According to Sankara,
whatever is, is Brahman, and Brahman itself is absolutely
homogeneous, so that all difference and plurality must be illusory.
According to R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja also, whatever is, is Brahman;
but Brahman is not of a homogeneous nature, but contains within
itself elements of plurality owing to which it truly manifests
itself in a diversified world. The world with its variety of
material forms of existence and individual souls is not unreal
M&acirc;y&acirc;, but a real part of Brahman's nature, the body
investing the universal Self. The Brahman of <i>S</i>a@nkara is in
itself impersonal, a homogeneous mass of objectless thought,
transcending all attributes; a personal God it becomes only through
its association with the unreal principle of M&acirc;y&acirc;, so
that&mdash;strictly speaking&mdash;<i>S</i>a@nkara's personal God,
his &Icirc;<i>s</i>vara, is himself something unreal.
R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja's Brahman, on the other hand, is essentially a
personal God, the all-powerful and all-wise ruler of a real world
permeated and animated by his spirit. There is thus no room for the
distinction between a param nirgu<i>n</i>am and an apara<i>m</i>
sagu<i>n</i>am brahma, between Brahman and
&Icirc;<i>s</i>vara.&mdash;<i>S</i>a@nkara's individual soul is
Brahman in so far as limited by the unreal up&acirc;dhis due to
M&acirc;y&acirc;. The individual soul of R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja, on
the other hand, is really individual; it has <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="pageintro-31" id="pageintro-31"></a>{Intro
31}</span> indeed sprung from Brahman and is never outside Brahman,
but nevertheless it enjoys a separate personal existence and will
remain a personality for ever&mdash;The release from
sa<i>m</i>s&acirc;ra means, according to <i>S</i>a@nkara, the
absolute merging of the individual soul in Brahman, due to the
dismissal of the erroneous notion that the soul is distinct from
Brahman; according to R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja it only means the soul's
passing from the troubles of earthly life into a kind of heaven or
paradise where it will remain for ever in undisturbed personal
bliss.&mdash;As R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja does not distinguish a higher
and lower Brahman, the distinction of a higher and lower knowledge
is likewise not valid for him; the teaching of the Upanishads is
not twofold but essentially one, and leads the enlightened devotee
to one result only<a id="footnotetag1" name=
"footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>I now proceed to give a conspectus of the contents of the
Ved&acirc;nta-s&ucirc;tras according to <i>S</i>a@nkara in which at
the same time all the more important points concerning which
R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja disagrees will be noted. We shall here have to
enter into details which to many may appear tedious. But it is only
on a broad substratum of accurately stated details that we can hope
to establish any definite conclusions regarding the comparative
value of the different modes of interpretation which have been
applied to the S&ucirc;tras. The line of investigation is an
entirely new one, and for the present nothing can be taken for
granted or known.&mdash;In stating the different heads of
discussion (the so-called adhikara<i>n</i>as), each of which
comprises one or more S&ucirc;tras, I shall follow the subdivision
into adhikara<i>n</i>as adopted in the
Vy&acirc;s&acirc;dhika-ra<i>n</i>am&acirc;l&acirc;, the text of
which is printed in the second volume of the Bibliotheca Indica
edition of the S&ucirc;tras.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-32" id=
"pageintro-32"></a>{Intro 32}</span>
<h3>FIRST ADHY&Acirc;YA.</h3>
<h4>P&Acirc;DA I.</h4>
<p>The first five adhikara<i>n</i>as lay down the fundamental
positions with regard to Brahman. Adhik. I (1)<a id="footnotetag2"
name="footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a>
treats of what the study of the Ved&acirc;nta presupposes. Adhik.
II (2) defines Brahman as that whence the world originates, and so
on. Adhik. III (3) declares that Brahman is the source of the Veda.
Adhik. IV (4) proves Brahman to be the uniform topic of all
Ved&acirc;nta-texts. Adhik. V (5-11) is engaged in proving by
various arguments that the Brahman, which the Ved&acirc;nta-texts
represent as the cause of the world, is an intelligent principle,
and cannot be identified with the non-intelligent pradh&acirc;na
from which the world springs according to the S&acirc;@nkhyas.</p>
<p>With the next adhikara<i>n</i>a there begins a series of
discussions of essentially similar character, extending up to the
end of the first adhy&acirc;ya. The question is throughout whether
certain terms met with in the Upanishads denote Brahman or some
other being, in most cases the j&icirc;va, the individual soul.
<i>S</i>a@nkara remarks at the outset that, as the preceding ten
S&ucirc;tras had settled the all-important point that all the
Ved&acirc;nta-texts refer to Brahman, the question now arises why
the enquiry should be continued any further, and thereupon proceeds
to explain that the acknowledged distinction of a higher Brahman
devoid of all qualities and a lower Brahman characterised by
qualities necessitates an investigation whether certain Vedic texts
of prim&acirc; facie doubtful import set forth the lower Brahman as
the object of devout meditation, or the higher Brahman as the
object of true knowledge. But that such an investigation is
actually carried on in the remaining portion of the first
adhy&acirc;ya, appears neither from the wording of the S&ucirc;tras
nor even from <i>S</i>a@nkara's own treatment of the Vedic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-33" id=
"pageintro-33"></a>{Intro 33}</span> texts referred to in the
S&ucirc;tras. In I, 1, 20, for instance, the question is raised
whether the golden man within the sphere of the sun, with golden
hair and beard and lotus-coloured eyes&mdash;of whom the
Ch&acirc;ndogya Upanishad speaks in 1, 6, 6&mdash;is an individual
soul abiding within the sun or the highest Lord. <i>S</i>a@nkara's
answer is that the passage refers to the Lord, who, for the
gratification of his worshippers, manifests himself in a bodily
shape made of M&acirc;y&acirc;. So that according to
<i>S</i>a@nkara himself the alternative lies between the
sagu<i>n</i>a Brahman and some particular individual soul, not
between the sagu<i>n</i>a Brahman and the nirgu<i>n</i>a
Brahman.</p>
<p>Adhik. VI (12-19) raises the question whether the
&acirc;nandamaya, mentioned in Taittir&icirc;ya Upanishad II, 5, is
merely a transmigrating individual soul or the highest Self.
<i>S</i>a@nkara begins by explaining the S&ucirc;tras on the latter
supposition&mdash;and the text of the S&ucirc;tras is certainly in
favour of that interpretation&mdash;gives, however, finally the
preference to a different and exceedingly forced explanation
according to which the S&ucirc;tras teach that the &acirc;nandamaya
is not Brahman, since the Upanishad expressly says that Brahman is
the tail or support of the &acirc;nandamaya<a id="footnotetag3"
name="footnotetag3"></a><a href=
"#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a>.&mdash;R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja's
interpretation of Adhikara<i>n</i>a VI, although not agreeing in
all particulars with the former explanation of <i>S</i>a@nkara, yet
is at one with it in the chief point, viz. that the
&acirc;nandamaya is Brahman. It further deserves notice that, while
<i>S</i>a@nkara looks on Adhik. VI as the first of a series of
interpretatory discussions, all of which treat the question whether
certain Vedic passages refer to Brahman or not,
R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja separates the adhikara<i>n</i>a from the
subsequent part of the p&acirc;da and connects it with what had
preceded. In Adhik. V it had been shown that Brahman cannot be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-34" id=
"pageintro-34"></a>{Intro 34}</span> identified with the
pradh&acirc;na; Adhik. VI shows that it is different from the
individual soul, and the proof of the fundamental position of the
system is thereby completed<a id="footnotetag4" name=
"footnotetag4"></a><a href=
"#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a>.&mdash;Adhik. VII (20, 21)
demonstrates that the golden person seen within the sun and the
person seen within the eye, mentioned in Ch. Up. I, 6, are not some
individual soul of high eminence, but the supreme
Brahman.&mdash;Adhik. VIII (22) teaches that by the ether from
which, according to Ch. Up. I, 9, all beings originate, not the
elemental ether has to be understood but the highest
Brahman.&mdash;Adhik. IX (23). The pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a also
mentioned in Ch. Up. I, ii, 5 denotes the highest Brahman<a id=
"footnotetag5" name="footnotetag5"></a><a href=
"#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a>&mdash;Adhik. X (24-27) teaches that
the light spoken of in Ch. Up. III, 13, 7 is not the ordinary
physical light but the highest Brahman<a id="footnotetag6" name=
"footnotetag6"></a><a href=
"#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a>.&mdash;Adhik. XI (28-31) decides that
the pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a mentioned in Kau. Up. III, 2 is Brahman.</p>
<h4>P&Acirc;DA II.</h4>
<p>Adhik. I (1-8) shows that the being which consists of mind,
whose body is breath, &amp;c., mentioned in Ch. Up. III, 14, is not
the individual soul, but Brahman. The S&ucirc;tras of this
adhikara<i>n</i>a emphatically dwell on the difference of the
individual soul and the highest Self, whence <i>S</i>a@nkara is
obliged to add an explanation&mdash;in his comment on S&ucirc;tra
6&mdash;to the effect that that difference is to be understood as
not real, but as due to the false limiting adjuncts of the highest
Self.&mdash;The comment of R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja throughout closely
follows the words of the S&ucirc;tras; on S&ucirc;tra 6 it simply
remarks that the difference of the highest Self <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="pageintro-35" id="pageintro-35"></a>{Intro
35}</span> from the individual soul rests thereon that the former
as free from all evil is not subject to the effects of works in the
same way as the soul is<a id="footnotetag7" name=
"footnotetag7"></a><a href=
"#footnote7"><sup>7</sup></a>.&mdash;Adhik. II (9, 10) decides that
he to whom the Brahmans and Kshattriyas are but food (Ka<i>th</i>a.
Up. I, 2, 25) is the highest Self.&mdash;Adhik. III (11, 12) shows
that the two entered into the cave (Ka<i>th</i>a Up. I, 3, 1) are
Brahman and the individual soul<a id="footnotetag8" name=
"footnotetag8"></a><a href=
"#footnote8"><sup>8</sup></a>.&mdash;Adhik. IV (13-17) shows that
the person within the eye mentioned in Ch. Up. IV, 15, 1 is
Brahman.&mdash;Adhik. V (18-20) shows that the ruler within
(antar&acirc;ymin) described in B<i>ri</i>. Up. III, 7, 3 is
Brahman. S&ucirc;tra 20 clearly enounces the difference of the
individual soul and the Lord; hence <i>S</i>a@nkara is obliged to
remark that that difference is not real.&mdash;Adhik. VI (21-23)
proves that that which cannot be seen, &amp;c, mentioned in
Mu<i>nd</i>aka Up. I, 1, 3 is Brahman.&mdash;Adhik. VII (24-32)
shows that the &acirc;tman vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara of Ch. Up. V,
11, 6 is Brahman.</p>
<h4>P&Acirc;DA III.</h4>
<p>Adhik. I (1-7) proves that that within which the heaven, the
earth, &amp;c. are woven (Mu<i>nd</i>. Up. II, 2, 5) is
Brahman.&mdash;Adhik. II (8, 9) shows that the bh&ucirc;man
referred to in Ch. Up. VII, 23 is Brahman.&mdash;Adhik. III (10-12)
teaches that the Imperishable in which, according to B<i>ri</i>.
Up. III, 8, 8, the ether is woven is Brahman.&mdash;Adhik. IV (13)
decides that the highest person who is to be meditated upon with
the syllable Om, according to Pra<i>s</i>na Up. V, 5, is not the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-36" id=
"pageintro-36"></a>{Intro 36}</span> lower but the higher
Brahman.&mdash;According to R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja the two
alternatives are Brahman and Brahm&acirc;
(j&icirc;vasamash<i>t</i>ir&ucirc;poz<i>nd</i>&acirc;dhipatis
<i>k</i>aturmukha<i>h</i>).&mdash;Adhik. V and VI (comprising,
according to <i>S</i>a@nkara, S&ucirc;tras l4-2l) discuss the
question whether the small ether within the lotus of the heart
mentioned in Ch. Up. VIII, 1 is the elemental ether or the
individual soul or Brahman; the last alternative being finally
adopted. In favour of the second alternative the p&ucirc;rvapakshin
pleads the two passages Ch. Up. VIII, 3, 4 and VIII, 12, 3, about
the serene being (sampras&acirc;da); for by the latter the
individual soul only can be understood, and in the chapter, of
which the latter passage forms part, there are ascribed to it the
same qualities (viz. freeness from sin, old age, death, &amp;c.)
that were predicated in VIII, 1, of the small ether within the
heart.&mdash;But the reply to this is, that the second passage
refers not to the (ordinary) individual soul but to the soul in
that state where its true nature has become manifest, i.e. in which
it is Brahman; so that the subject of the passage is in reality not
the so-called individual soul but Brahman. And in the former of the
two passages the soul is mentioned not on its own account, but
merely for the purpose of intimating that the highest Self is the
cause through which the individual soul manifests itself in its
true nature.&mdash;What R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja understands by the
&acirc;virbh&acirc;va of the soul will appear from the remarks on
IV, 4.</p>
<p>The two next S&ucirc;tras (22, 23) constitute, according to
<i>S</i>a@nkara, a new adhikara<i>n</i>a (VII), proving that he
'after whom everything shines, by whose light all this is lighted'
(Ka<i>th</i>a Up. II, 5, 15) is not some material luminous body,
but Brahman itself.&mdash;According to R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja the two
S&ucirc;tras do not start a new topic, but merely furnish some
further arguments strengthening the conclusion arrived at in the
preceding S&ucirc;tras.<a id="footnotetag9" name=
"footnotetag9"></a><a href="#footnote9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-37" id=
"pageintro-37"></a>{Intro 37}</span>
<p>Adhik. VIII (24, 25) decides that the person of the size of a
thumb mentioned in Ka<i>th</i>a Up. II, 4, 12 is not the individual
soul but Brahman.</p>
<p>The two next adhikara<i>n</i>as are of the nature of a
digression. The passage about the a@ngush<i>th</i>am&acirc;tra was
explained on the ground that the human heart is of the size of a
span; the question may then be asked whether also such individuals
as belong to other classes than mankind, more particularly the
Gods, are capable of the knowledge of Brahman: a question finally
answered in the affirmative.&mdash;This discussion leads in its
turn to several other digressions, among which the most important
one refers to the problem in what relation the different species of
beings stand to the words denoting them (S&ucirc;tra 28). In
connexion herewith <i>S</i>a@nkara treats of the nature of words
(<i>s</i>abda), opposing the opinion of the
M&icirc;m&acirc;<i>m</i>saka Upavarsha, according to whom the word
is nothing but the aggregate of its constitutive letters, to the
view of the grammarians who teach that over and above the aggregate
of the letters there exists a super-sensuous entity called
'spho<i>t</i>a,' which is the direct cause of the apprehension of
the sense of a word (Adhik. IX; S&ucirc;tras 26-33).</p>
<p>Adhik. X (34-38) explains that <i>S</i>&ucirc;dras are
altogether disqualified for Brahmavidy&acirc;.</p>
<p>S&ucirc;tra 39 constitutes, according to <i>S</i>a@nkara, a new
adhikara<i>n</i>a (XI), proving that the pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a in
which everything trembles, according to <i>K</i>a<i>th</i>a Up. II,
6, 2, is Brahman.&mdash;According to R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja the
S&ucirc;tra does not introduce a new topic but merely furnishes an
additional reason for the <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"pageintro-38" id="pageintro-38"></a>{Intro 38}</span> decision
arrived at under S&ucirc;tras 24, 25, viz. that the
a@ngus<i>th</i>am&acirc;tra is Brahman. On this supposition,
S&ucirc;tras 24-39 form one adhikara<i>n</i>a in which 26-38
constitute a mere digression led up to by the mention made of the
heart in 25.&mdash;The a@ngus<i>th</i>m&acirc;tra is referred to
twice in the Ka<i>th</i>a Upanishad, once in the passage discussed
(II, 4, 12), and once in II, 6, 17 ('the Person not larger than a
thumb'). To determine what is meant by the
a@ngus<i>th</i>m&acirc;tra, R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja says, we are
enabled by the passage II, 6, 2, 3, which is intermediate between
the two passages concerning the a@ngus<i>th</i>m&acirc;tra, and
which clearly refers to the highest Brahman, of which alone
everything can be said to stand in awe.</p>
<p>The next S&ucirc;tra (40) gives rise to a similar difference of
opinion. According to <i>S</i>a@nkara it constitutes by itself a
new adhikara<i>n</i>a (XII), proving that the 'light' (jyotis)
mentioned in Ch. Up. VIII, 12, 3 is the highest
Brahman.&mdash;According to R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja the S&ucirc;tra
continues the preceding adhikara<i>n</i>a, and strengthens the
conclusion arrived at by a further argument, referring to
Ka<i>th</i>a Up. II, 5, 15&mdash;a passage intermediate between the
two passages about the a@ngush<i>th</i>am&acirc;tra&mdash;which
speaks of a primary light that cannot mean anything but Brahman.
The S&ucirc;tra has in that case to be translated as follows: '(The
a@ngush<i>th</i>am&acirc;tra is Brahman) because (in a passage
intervening between the two) a light is seen to be mentioned (which
can be Brahman only).'</p>
<p>The three last S&ucirc;tras of the p&acirc;da are, according to
<i>S</i>a@nkara, to be divided into two adhikara<i>n</i>as (XIII
and XIV), S&ucirc;tra 41 deciding that the ether which reveals
names and forms (Ch. Up. VIII, 14) is not the elemental ether but
Brahman; and 42, 43 teaching that the
vij<i>&ntilde;</i>&acirc;namaya, 'he who consists of knowledge,' of
B<i>ri</i>. Up. IV, 3, 7 is not the individual soul but
Brahman.&mdash;According to R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja the three
S&ucirc;tras make up one single adhikara<i>n</i>a discussing
whether the Chandogya Upanishad passage about the ether refers to
Brahman or to the individual soul in the state of release; the
latter of these two alternatives being suggested by the
circumstance that the released soul is the subject of the passage
immediately preceding ('Shaking off <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"pageintro-39" id="pageintro-39"></a>{Intro 39}</span> all evil as
a horse shakes off his hair,' &amp;c.). S&ucirc;tra 41 decides that
'the ether (is Brahman) because the passage designates the nature
of something else,' &amp;c. (i.e. of something other than the
individual soul; other because to the soul the revealing of names
and forms cannot be ascribed, &amp;c.)&mdash;But, an objection is
raised, does not more than one scriptural passage show that the
released soul and Brahman are identical, and is not therefore the
ether which reveals names and forms the soul as well as
Brahman?&mdash;(The two, S&ucirc;tra 42 replies, are different)
'because in the states of deep sleep and departing (the highest
Self) is designated as different' (from the soul)&mdash;which point
is proved by the same scriptural passages which <i>S</i>a@nkara
adduces;&mdash;and 'because such terms as Lord and the like' cannot
be applied to the individual soul (43). Reference is made to IV, 4,
14, where all jagadvy&acirc;p&acirc;ra is said to belong to the
Lord only, not to the soul even when in the state of release.</p>
<h4>P&Acirc;DA IV.</h4>
<p>The last p&acirc;da of the first adhy&acirc;ya is specially
directed against the S&acirc;@nkhyas.</p>
<p>The first adhikara<i>n</i>a (1-7) discusses the passage
Ka<i>th</i>a Up. I, 3, 10; 11, where mention is made of the Great
and the Undeveloped&mdash;both of them terms used with a special
technical sense in the S&acirc;@nkhya-<i>s</i>&acirc;stra, avyakta
being a synonym for pradh&acirc;na.&mdash;<i>S</i>a@nkara shows by
an exhaustive review of the topics of the Ka<i>th</i>a Upanishad
that the term avyakta has not the special meaning which the
S&acirc;@nkhyas attribute to it, but denotes the body, more
strictly the subtle body (s&ucirc;kshma <i>s</i>ar&icirc;ra), but
at the same time the gross body also, in so far as it is viewed as
an effect of the subtle one.</p>
<p>Adhik. II (8-10) demonstrates, according to <i>S</i>a@nkara,
that the tricoloured aj&acirc; spoken of in <i>S</i>ve. Up. IV, 5
is not the pradh&acirc;na of the S&acirc;nkhyas, but either that
power of the Lord from which the world springs, or else the primary
causal matter first produced by that power.&mdash;What
R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja <span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-40"
id="pageintro-40"></a>{Intro 40}</span> in contradistinction from
<i>S</i>a@nkara understands by the primary causal matter, follows
from the short sketch given above of the two systems.</p>
<p>Adhik. III (11-13) shows that the pa<i>&ntilde;k</i>a
pa<i>&ntilde;k</i>ajan&acirc;<i>h</i> mentioned in B<i>ri</i>. Up.
IV, 4, 17 are not the twenty-five principles of the
S&acirc;@nkhyas.&mdash;Adhik. IV (14, 15) proves that Scripture
does not contradict itself on the all-important point of Brahman,
i.e. a being whose essence is intelligence, being the cause of the
world.</p>
<p>Adhik. V (16-18) is, according to <i>S</i>a@nkara, meant to
prove that 'he who is the maker of those persons, of whom this is
the work,' mentioned in Kau. Up. IV, 19, is not either the vital
air or the individual soul, but Brahman.&mdash;The subject of the
adhikara<i>n</i>a is essentially the same in R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja's
view; greater stress is, however, laid on the adhikara<i>n</i>a
being polemical against the S&acirc;@nkhyas, who wish to turn the
passage into an argument for the pradh&acirc;na doctrine.</p>
<p>The same partial difference of view is observable with regard to
the next adhikara<i>n</i>a (VI; S&ucirc;tras 19-22) which decides
that the 'Self to be seen, to be heard,' &amp;c. (B<i>ri</i>. Up.
II, 4, 5) is the highest Self, not the individual soul. This latter
passage also is, according to R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja, made the
subject of discussion in order to rebut the S&acirc;@nkhya who is
anxious to prove that what is there inculcated as the object of
knowledge is not a universal Self but merely the S&acirc;@nkhya
purusha.</p>
<p>Adhik. VII (23-27) teaches that Brahman is not only the
efficient or operative cause (nimitta) of the world, but its
material cause as well. The world springs from Brahman by way of
modification (pari<i>n</i>&acirc;ma; S&ucirc;tra
26).&mdash;R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja views this adhikara<i>n</i>a as
specially directed against the Se<i>s</i>vara-s&acirc;@nkhyas who
indeed admit the existence of a highest Lord, but postulate in
addition an independent pradh&acirc;na on which the Lord acts as an
operative cause merely.</p>
<p>Adhik. VIII (28) remarks that the refutation of the
S&acirc;@nkhya views is applicable to other theories also, such as
the doctrine of the world having originated from atoms.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-41" id=
"pageintro-41"></a>{Intro 41}</span>
<p>After this rapid survey of the contents of the first
adhy&acirc;ya and the succinct indication of the most important
points in which the views of <i>S</i>a@nkara and
R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja diverge, we turn to a short consideration of
two questions which here naturally present themselves, viz.,
firstly, which is the principle on which the Vedic passages
referred to in the S&ucirc;tras have been selected and arranged;
and, secondly, if, where <i>S</i>a@nkara and R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja
disagree as to the subdivision of the S&ucirc;tras into
Adhikara<i>n</i>as, and the determination of the Vedic passages
discussed in the S&ucirc;tras, there are to be met with any
indications enabling us to determine which of the two commentators
is right. (The more general question as to how far the S&ucirc;tras
favour either <i>S</i>a@nkara's or R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja's general
views cannot be considered at present.)</p>
<p>The Hindu commentators here and there attempt to point out the
reason why the discussion of a certain Vedic passage is immediately
followed by the consideration of a certain other one. Their
explanations&mdash;which have occasionally been referred to in the
notes to the translation&mdash;rest on the assumption that the
S&ucirc;trak&acirc;ra in arranging the texts to be commented upon
was guided by technicalities of the
M&icirc;m&acirc;<i>m</i>s&acirc;-system, especially by a regard for
the various so-called means of proof which the
M&icirc;m&acirc;<i>m</i>saka employs for the purpose of determining
the proper meaning and position of scriptural passages. But that
this was the guiding principle, is rendered altogether improbable
by a simple tabular statement of the Vedic passages referred to in
the first adhy&acirc;ya, such as given by Deussen on page 130; for
from the latter it appears that the order in which the S&ucirc;tras
exhibit the scriptural passages follows the order in which those
passages themselves occur in the Upanishads, and it would certainly
be a most strange coincidence if that order enabled us at the same
time to exemplify the various pram&acirc;<i>n</i>as of the
M&icirc;m&acirc;<i>m</i>s&acirc; in their due systematic
succession.</p>
<p>As Deussen's statement shows, most of the passages discussed are
taken from the Ch&acirc;ndogya Upanishad, so many indeed that the
whole first adhy&acirc;ya may be said to consist of a discussion of
all those Ch&acirc;ndogya passages of which it <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="pageintro-42" id="pageintro-42"></a>{Intro
42}</span> is doubtful whether they are concerned with Brahman or
not, passages from the other Upanishads being brought in wherever
an opportunity offers. Considering the prominent position assigned
to the Upanishad mentioned, I think it likely that the
S&ucirc;trak&acirc;ra meant to begin the series of doubtful texts
with the first doubtful passage from the Ch&acirc;ndogya, and that
hence the sixth adhikara<i>n</i>a which treats of the
an&acirc;ndamaya mentioned in the Taittir&icirc;ya Upanishad has,
in agreement with R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja's views, to be separated
from the subsequent adhikara<i>n</i>as, and to be combined with the
preceding ones whose task it is to lay down the fundamental
propositions regarding Brahman's nature.&mdash;The remaining
adhikara<i>n</i>as of the first p&acirc;da follow the order of
passages in the Ch&acirc;ndogya Upanishad, and therefore call for
no remark; with the exception of the last adhikara<i>n</i>a, which
refers to a Kaush&icirc;taki passage, for whose being introduced in
this place I am not able to account.&mdash;The first
adhikara<i>n</i>a of the second p&acirc;da returns to the
Ch&acirc;ndogya Upanishad. The second one treats of a passage in
the Ka<i>th</i>a Upanishad where a being is referred to which eats
everything. The reason why that passage is introduced in this place
seems to be correctly assigned in the
<i>S</i>r&icirc;-bh&acirc;shya, which remarks that, as in the
preceding S&ucirc;tra it had been argued that the highest Self is
not an enjoyer, a doubt arises whether by that being which eats
everything the highest Self can be meant<a id="footnotetag10" name=
"footnotetag10"></a><a href=
"#footnote10"><sup>10</sup></a>&mdash;The third adhikara<i>n</i>a
again, whose topic is the 'two entered into the cave' (Ka<i>th</i>a
Up. I, 3, 1), appears, as R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja remarks, to come in
at this place owing to the preceding adhikara<i>n</i>a; for if it
could not be proved that one of the two is the highest Self, a
doubt would attach to the explanation given above of the 'eater'
since the 'two entered into the cave,' and the 'eater' stand under
the same prakara<i>n</i>a, and must therefore be held to refer to
the same matter.&mdash;The fourth adhikara<i>n</i>a is again
occupied with a Ch&acirc;ndogya passage.&mdash;The fifth
adhikara<i>n</i>a, whose topic is the Ruler within
(antary&acirc;min), manifestly owes its place, as remarked by
R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja also, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"pageintro-43" id="pageintro-43"></a>{Intro 43}</span> to the fact
that the Vedic passage treated had been employed in the preceding
adhikara<i>n</i>a (I, 2, 14) for the purpose of strengthening the
argument<a id="footnotetag11" name="footnotetag11"></a><a href=
"#footnote11"><sup>11</sup></a>.&mdash;The sixth adhikara<i>n</i>a,
again, which discusses 'that which is not seen' (adre<i>s</i>ya;
Mu<i>nd</i>. Up. I, 1, 6), is clearly introduced in this place
because in the preceding adhikara<i>n</i>a it had been said that
ad<i>ri</i>sh<i>t</i>a, &amp;c. denote the highest Self;&mdash;The
reasons to which the last adhikara<i>n</i>a of the second
p&acirc;da and the first and third adhikara<i>n</i>as of the third
p&acirc;da owe their places are not apparent (the second
adhikara<i>n</i>a of the third p&acirc;da treats of a
Ch&acirc;ndogya passage). The introduction, on the other hand, of
the passage from the Pra<i>s</i>na Upanishad treating of the
akshara. O<i>m</i>k&acirc;ra is clearly due to the circumstance
that an akshara, of a different nature, had been discussed in the
preceding adhikara<i>n</i>a.&mdash;The fifth and sixth
adhikara<i>n</i>as investigate Ch&acirc;ndogya passages.&mdash;The
two next S&ucirc;tras (22, 23) are, as remarked above, considered
by <i>S</i>a@nkara to constitute a new adhikara<i>n</i>a treating
of the 'being after which everything shines' (Mu<i>nd</i>. Up. II,
2, 10); while R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja looks on them as continuing the
sixth adhikara<i>n</i>a. There is one circumstance which renders it
at any rate probable that R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja, and not
<i>S</i>a@nkara, here hits the intention of the author of the
S&ucirc;tras. The general rule in the first three p&acirc;das is
that, wherever a new Vedic passage is meant to be introduced, the
subject of the discussion, i.e. that being which in the end is
declared to be Brahman is referred to by means of a special word,
in most cases a nominative form<a id="footnotetag12" name=
"footnotetag12"></a><a href="#footnote12"><sup>12</sup></a>. From
this rule there is in the preceding part of the adhy&acirc;ya only
one real exception, viz. in I, 2, 1, which possibly may be due to
the fact that there a new p&acirc;da begins, and it therefore was
considered superfluous <span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-44"
id="pageintro-44"></a>{Intro 44}</span> to indicate the
introduction of a new topic by a special word. The exception
supplied by I, 3, 19 is only an apparent one; for, as remarked
above, S&ucirc;tra 19 does not in reality begin a new
adhikara<i>n</i>a. A few exceptions occurring later on will be
noticed in their places.&mdash;Now neither S&ucirc;tra 22 nor
S&ucirc;tra 23 contains any word intimating that a new Vedic
passage is being taken into consideration, and hence it appears
preferable to look upon them, with R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja, as
continuing the topic of the preceding adhikara<i>n</i>a.&mdash;This
conclusion receives an additional confirmation from the position of
the next adhikara<i>n</i>a, which treats of the being 'a span long'
mentioned in Ka<i>th</i>a Up. II, 4, 12; for the reason of this
latter passage being considered here is almost certainly the
reference to the alpa<i>s</i>ruti in S&ucirc;tra 21, and, if so,
the a@ngush<i>th</i>am&aacute;tra properly constitutes the subject
of the adhikara<i>n</i>a immediately following on Adhik. V, VI;
which, in its turn, implies that S&ucirc;tras 22, 23 do not form an
independent adhikara<i>n</i>a.&mdash;The two next
adhikara<i>n</i>as are digressions, and do not refer to special
Vedic passages.&mdash;S&ucirc;tra 39 forms a new adhikara<i>n</i>a,
according to <i>S</i>a@nkara, but not according to
R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja, whose opinion seems again to be countenanced
by the fact that the S&ucirc;tra does not exhibit any word
indicative of a new topic. The same difference of opinion prevails
with regard to S&ucirc;tra 40, and it appears from the translation
of the S&ucirc;tra given above, according to R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja's
view, that 'jyoti<i>h</i>' need not be taken as a
nominative.&mdash;The last two adhikara<i>n</i>as finally refer,
according to R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja, to one Ch&acirc;ndogya passage
only, and here also we have to notice that S&ucirc;tra 42 does not
comprise any word intimating that a new passage is about to be
discussed.</p>
<p>From all this we seem entitled to draw the following
conclusions. The Vedic passages discussed in the three first
p&acirc;das of the Ved&aacute;nta-s&ucirc;tras comprise all the
doubtful&mdash;or at any rate all the more important
doubtful&mdash;passages from the Ch&acirc;ndogya Upanishad. These
passages are arranged in the order in which the text of the
Upanishad exhibits them. Passages from other Upanishads are
discussed as opportunities offer, there being always a special
reason why a certain Ch&acirc;ndogya passage is followed by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-45" id=
"pageintro-45"></a>{Intro 45}</span> a certain passage from some
other Upanishad. Those reasons can be assigned with sufficient
certainty in a number of cases although not in all, and from among
those passages whose introduction cannot be satisfactorily
accounted for some are eliminated by our following the subdivision
of the S&ucirc;tras into adhikara<i>n</i>as adopted by
R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja, a subdivision countenanced by the external
form of the S&ucirc;tras.</p>
<p>The fourth p&acirc;da of the first adhy&acirc;ya has to be taken
by itself. It is directed specially and avowedly against
S&acirc;@nkhya-interpretations of Scripture, not only in its
earlier part which discusses isolated passages, but also&mdash;as
is brought out much more clearly in the
<i>S</i>r&icirc;-bh&acirc;shya than by <i>S</i>a@nkara&mdash;in its
latter part which takes a general survey of the entire scriptural
evidence for Brahman being the material as well as the operative
cause of the world.</p>
<p>Deussen (p. 221) thinks that the selection made by the
S&ucirc;trak&acirc;ra of Vedic passages setting forth the nature of
Brahman is not in all cases an altogether happy one. But this
reproach rests on the assumption that the passages referred to in
the first adhy&acirc;ya were chosen for the purpose of throwing
light on what Brahman is, and this assumption can hardly be upheld.
The Ved&acirc;nta-s&ucirc;tras as well as the P&ucirc;rv&acirc;
M&icirc;m&acirc;<i>m</i>s&acirc;-s&ucirc;tras are throughout
M&icirc;m&acirc;<i>m</i>s&acirc; i.e. critical discussions of such
scriptural passages as on a prim&acirc; facie view admit of
different interpretations and therefore necessitate a careful
enquiry into their meaning. Here and there we meet with
Sutr&acirc;s which do not directly involve a discussion of the
sense of some particular Vedic passage, but rather make a mere
statement on some important point. But those cases are rare, and it
would be altogether contrary to the general spirit of the
Sutr&acirc;s to assume that a whole adhy&acirc;ya should be devoted
to the task of showing what Brahman is. The latter point is
sufficiently determined in the first five (or six)
adhikara<i>n</i>as; but after we once know what Brahman is we are
at once confronted by a number of Upanishad passages concerning
which it is doubtful whether they refer to Brahman or not. With
their discussion all the remaining adhikara<i>n</i>as of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-46" id=
"pageintro-46"></a>{Intro 46}</span> first adhy&acirc;ya are
occupied. That the Ved&acirc;nta-s&ucirc;tras view it as a
particularly important task to controvert the doctrine of the
S&acirc;@nkhyas is patent (and has also been fully pointed out by
Deussen, p. 23). The fifth adhikara<i>n</i>a already declares
itself against the doctrine that the world has sprung from a
non-intelligent principle, the pradh&acirc;na, and the fourth
p&acirc;da of the first adhy&acirc;ya returns to an express polemic
against S&acirc;@nkhya interpretations of certain Vedic statements.
It is therefore perhaps not saying too much if we maintain that the
entire first adhy&acirc;ya is due to the wish, on the part of the
S&ucirc;trak&acirc;ra, to guard his own doctrine against
S&acirc;@nkhya attacks. Whatever the attitude of the other
so-called orthodox systems may be towards the Veda, the
S&acirc;@nkhya system is the only one whose adherents were
anxious&mdash;and actually attempted&mdash;to prove that their
views are warranted by scriptural passages. The S&acirc;@nkhya
tendency thus would be to show that all those Vedic texts which the
Ved&acirc;ntin claims as teaching the existence of Brahman, the
intelligent and sole cause of the world, refer either to the
pradh&acirc;na or some product of the pradh&acirc;na, or else to
the purusha in the S&acirc;nkhya sense, i.e. the individual soul.
It consequently became the task of the Ved&acirc;ntin to guard the
Upanishads against misinterpretations of the kind, and this he did
in the first adhy&acirc;ya of the Ved&acirc;nta-s&ucirc;tras,
selecting those passages about whose interpretation doubts were,
for some reason or other, likely to arise. Some of the passages
singled out are certainly obscure, and hence liable to various
interpretations; of others it is less apparent why it was thought
requisite to discuss them at length. But this is hardly a matter in
which we are entitled to find fault with the
S&ucirc;trak&aacute;ra; for no modern scholar, either European or
Hindu, is&mdash;or can possibly be&mdash;sufficiently at home, on
the one hand, in the religious and philosophical views which
prevailed at the time when the S&ucirc;tras may have been composed,
and, on the other hand, in the intricacies of the
M&icirc;m&acirc;<i>m</i>s&acirc;, to judge with confidence which
Vedic passages may give rise to discussions and which not.</p>

<p>Deussen's supposition (pp. 30, 150) that the passage conveying
the second interpretation is an interpolation is liable to two
objections. In the first place, the passage is accepted and
explained by all commentators; in the second place, <i>S</i>a@nkara
in the passage immediately preceding S&ucirc;tra 12 quotes the
adhikara<i>n</i>a '&acirc;nandamayo s bhy&acirc;s&agrave;t' as
giving rise to a discussion whether the param or the aparam brahman
is meant. Now this latter point is not touched upon at all in that
part of the bh&acirc;shya which sets forth the former explanation,
but only in the subsequent passage, which refutes the former and
advocates the latter interpretation.</p>

<p>The second interpretation given on pp. 184-5 of the Sanskrit
text (beginning with apara &acirc;ha) Deussen considers to be an
interpolation, caused by the reference to the Paingi upanishad in

reason whatsoever for such an assumption. The passage on p. 232

<h3>SECOND ADHY&Acirc;YA.</h3>
<p>The first adhy&acirc;ya has proved that all the
Ved&acirc;nta-texts unanimously teach that there is only one cause
of the world, viz. Brahman, whose nature is intelligence, and that
there exists no scriptural passage which can be used to establish
systems opposed to the Ved&acirc;nta, more especially the
S&acirc;@nkhya system. The task of the two first p&acirc;das of the
second adhy&acirc;ya is to rebut any objections which may be raised
against the Ved&acirc;nta doctrine on purely speculative grounds,
apart from scriptural authority, and to show, again on purely
speculative grounds, that none of the systems irreconcilable with
the Ved&acirc;nta can be satisfactorily established.</p>
<h4>P&Acirc;DA I.</h4>
<p>Adhikara<i>n</i>a I refutes the S&acirc;@nkhya objection that
the acceptation of the Ved&acirc;nta system involves the rejection
of the S&acirc;@nkhya doctrine which after all constitutes a part
of Sm<i>ri</i>ti, and as such has claims on consideration.&mdash;To
accept the S&acirc;@nkhya-sm<i>ri</i>ti, the Ved&acirc;ntin
replies, would compel us to reject other Sm<i>ri</i>tis, such as
the Manu-sm<i>ri</i>ti, which are opposed to the S&acirc;@nkhya
doctrine. The conflicting claims of Sm<i>ri</i>tis can be settled
only on the ground of the Veda, and there can be no doubt that the
Veda does not confirm the S&acirc;@nkhya-sm<i>ri</i>ti, but rather
those Sm<i>ri</i>tis which teach the origination of the world from
an intelligent primary cause.</p>
<p>Adhik. II (3) extends the same line of argumentation to the
Yoga-sm<i>ri</i>ti.</p>
<p>Adhik. III (4-11) shows that Brahman, although of the nature of
intelligence, yet may be the cause of the non-intelligent material
world, and that it is not contaminated by the qualities of the
world when the latter is refunded into Brahman. For ordinary
experience teaches us that like does not always spring from like,
and that the qualities of effected things when the latter are
refunded into their causes&mdash;as when golden ornaments, for
instance, are melted <span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-48"
id="pageintro-48"></a>{Intro 48}</span> and thereby become simple
gold again&mdash;do not continue to exist in those
causes.&mdash;Here also the argumentation is specially directed
against the S&acirc;@nkhyas, who, in order to account for the
materiality and the various imperfections of the world, think it
necessary to assume a causal substance participating in the same
characteristics.</p>
<p>Adhik. IV (12) points out that the line of reasoning followed in
the preceding adhikara<i>n</i>a is valid also against other
theories, such as the atomistic doctrine.</p>
<p>The one S&ucirc;tra (13) constituting Adhik. V teaches,
according to <i>S</i>a@nkara, that although the enjoying souls as
well as the objects of fruition are in reality nothing but Brahman,
and on that account identical, yet the two sets may practically be
held apart, just as in ordinary life we hold apart, and distinguish
as separate individual things, the waves, ripples, and foam of the
sea, although at the bottom waves, ripples, and foam are all of
them identical as being neither more nor less than
sea-water.&mdash;The <i>S</i>r&icirc;-bh&acirc;shya gives a totally
different interpretation of the S&ucirc;tra, according to which the
latter has nothing whatever to do with the eventual non-distinction
of enjoying souls and objects to be enjoyed. Translated according
to R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja's view, the S&ucirc;tra runs as follows:
'If non-distinction (of the Lord and the individual souls) is said
to result from the circumstance of (the Lord himself) becoming an
enjoyer (a soul), we refute this objection by instances from
every-day experience.' That is to say: If it be maintained that
from our doctrine previously expounded, according to which this
world springs from the Lord and constitutes his body, it follows
that the Lord, as an embodied being, is not essentially different
from other souls, and subject to fruition as they are; we reply
that the Lord's having a body does not involve his being subject to
fruition, not any more than in ordinary life a king, although
himself an embodied being, is affected by the experiences of
pleasure and pain which his servants have to undergo.&mdash;The
construction which R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja puts on the S&ucirc;tra is
not repugnant either to the words of the S&ucirc;tra or to the
context in which the latter stands, and that it rests on earlier
authority appears <span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-49" id=
"pageintro-49"></a>{Intro 49}</span> from a quotation made by
R&acirc;m&agrave;nuja from the
Drami<i>d</i>abh&acirc;shyak&acirc;ra<a id="footnotetag13" name=
"footnotetag13"></a><a href="#footnote13"><sup>13</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Adhik. VI (14-20) treats of the non-difference of the effect
from the cause; a Ved&acirc;nta doctrine which is defended by its
adherents against the Vai<i>s</i>eshikas according to whom the
effect is something different from the cause.&mdash;The divergent
views of <i>S</i>a@nkara and R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja on this important
point have been sufficiently illustrated in the general sketch of
the two systems.</p>
<p>Adhik. VII (21-23) refutes the objection that, from the Vedic
passages insisting on the identity of the Lord and the individual
soul, it follows that the Lord must be like the individual soul the
cause of evil, and that hence the entire doctrine of an
all-powerful and all-wise Lord being the cause of the world has to
be rejected. For, the S&ucirc;trak&icirc;ra remarks, the creative
principle of the world is additional to, i.e. other than, the
individual soul, the difference of the two being distinctly
declared by Scripture.&mdash;The way in which the three
S&ucirc;tras constituting this adhikara<i>n</i>a are treated by
<i>S</i>a@nkara on the one hand and R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja on the
other is characteristic. R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja throughout simply
follows the words of the S&ucirc;tras, of which S&ucirc;tra 21
formulates the objection based on such texts as 'Thou art that,'
while S&ucirc;tra 22 replies that Brahman is different from the
soul, since that is expressly declared by Scripture.
<i>S</i>a@nkara, on the other hand, sees himself obliged to add
that the difference of the two, plainly maintained in S&ucirc;tra
22, is not real, but due to the soul's fictitious limiting
adjuncts.</p>
<p>Adhik. VIII (24, 25) shows that Brahman, although destitute of
material and instruments of action, may yet produce the world, just
as gods by their mere power create <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"pageintro-50" id="pageintro-50"></a>{Intro 50}</span> palaces,
animals, and the like, and as milk by itself turns into curds.</p>
<p>Adhik. IX (26-29) explains that, according to the express
doctrine of Scripture, Brahman does not in its entirety pass over
into the world, and, although emitting the world from itself, yet
remains one and undivided. This is possible, according to
<i>S</i>a@nkara, because the world is unreal; according to
R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja, because the creation is merely the visible
and tangible manifestation of what previously existed in Brahman in
a subtle imperceptible condition.</p>
<p>Adhik. X (30, 31) teaches that Brahman, although destitute of
instruments of action, is enabled to create the world by means of
the manifold powers which it possesses.</p>
<p>Adhik. XI (32, 33) assigns the motive of the creation, or, more
properly expressed, teaches that Brahman, in creating the world,
has no motive in the strict sense of the word, but follows a mere
sportive impulse.</p>
<p>Adhik. XII (34-36) justifies Brahman from the charges of
partiality and cruelty which might be brought against it owing to
the inequality of position and fate of the various animate beings,
and the universal suffering of the world. Brahman, as a creator and
dispenser, acts with a view to the merit and demerit of the
individual souls, and has so acted from all eternity.</p>
<p>Adhik. XIII (37) sums up the preceding argumentation by
declaring that all the qualities of Brahman&mdash;omniscience and
so on&mdash;are such as to capacitate it for the creation of the
world.</p>
<h4>P&Acirc;DA II.</h4>
<p>The task of the second p&acirc;da is to refute, by arguments
independent of Vedic passages, the more important philosophical
theories concerning the origin of the world which are opposed to
the Ved&acirc;nta view.&mdash;The first adhikara<i>n</i>a (1-10) is
directed against the S&acirc;@nkhyas, whose doctrine had already
been touched upon incidentally in several previous places, and aims
at proving that a non-intelligent first cause, such as the
pradh&acirc;na of the S&acirc;@nkhyas, is unable to create and
dispose.&mdash;The second adhikara<i>n</i>a (11-17) refutes the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-51" id=
"pageintro-51"></a>{Intro 51}</span> Vai<i>s</i>eshika tenet that
the world originates from atoms set in motion by the
ad<i>ri</i>sh<i>t</i>a.&mdash;The third and fourth
adhikara<i>n</i>as are directed against various schools of Bauddha
philosophers. Adhik. III (18-27) impugns the view of the so-called
sarv&acirc;stitvav&acirc;dins, or
b&acirc;hy&acirc;rthav&acirc;dins, who maintain the reality of an
external as well as an internal world; Adhik. IV (28-32) is
directed against the vij<i>&ntilde;</i>&acirc;nav&acirc;dins,
according to whom ideas are the only reality.&mdash;The last
S&ucirc;tra of this adhikara<i>n</i>a is treated by
R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja as a separate adhikara<i>n</i>a refuting the
view of the M&acirc;dhyamikas, who teach that everything is void,
i.e. that nothing whatever is real.&mdash;Adhik. V (33-36) is
directed against the doctrine of the Jainas; Adhik. VI (37-41)
against those philosophical schools which teach that a highest Lord
is not the material but only the operative cause of the world.</p>
<p>The last adhikara<i>n</i>a of the p&acirc;da (42-45) refers,
according to the unanimous statement of the commentators, to the
doctrine of the Bh&acirc;gavatas or
P&acirc;<i>&ntilde;k</i>ar&acirc;tras. But <i>S</i>a@nkara and
R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja totally disagree as to the drift of the
S&ucirc;trak&acirc;ra's opinion regarding that system. According to
the former it is condemned like the systems previously referred to;
according to the latter it is approved of.&mdash;S&ucirc;tras 42
and 43, according to both commentators, raise objections against
the system; S&ucirc;tra 42 being directed against the doctrine that
from the highest being, called V&acirc;sudeva, there is originated
Sa@nkarsha<i>n</i>a, i.e. the jiva, on the ground that thereby
those scriptural passages would be contradicted which teach the
soul's eternity; and S&ucirc;tra 43 impugning the doctrine that
from Sa@nkarsha<i>n</i>a there springs Pradyumna, i.e. the
manas.&mdash;The S&ucirc;tra on which the difference of
interpretation turns is 44. Literally translated it runs, 'Or, on
account of there being' (or, 'their being') 'knowledge and so on,
there is non-contradiction of that.'&mdash;This means, according to
<i>S</i>a@nkara, 'Or, if in consequence of the existence of
knowledge and so on (on the part of Sa@nkarsha<i>n</i>a, &amp;c.
they be taken not as soul, mind, &amp;c. but as Lords of
pre-eminent knowledge, &amp;c.), yet there is non-contradiction of
that (viz. of the objection raised in S&ucirc;tra 42 against the
Bh&acirc;gavata doctrine).'&mdash;According <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="pageintro-52" id="pageintro-52"></a>{Intro
52}</span> to R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja, on the other hand, the
S&ucirc;tra has to be explained as follows: 'Or, rather there is
noncontradiction of that (i.e. the Pa<i>&ntilde;k</i>ar&acirc;tra
doctrine) on account of their being knowledge and so on (i.e. on
account of their being Brahman).' Which means: Since
Sa@nkarsha<i>n</i>a and so on are merely forms of manifestation of
Brahman, the P&acirc;<i>&ntilde;k</i>ar&acirc;tra doctrine,
according to which they spring from Brahman, is not
contradicted.&mdash;The form of the S&ucirc;tra makes it difficult
for us to decide which of the two interpretations is the right one;
it, however, appears to me that the explanations of the 'v&acirc;'
and of the 'tat,' implied in R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja's comment, are
more natural than those resulting from <i>S</i>a@nkara's
interpretation. Nor would it be an unnatural proceeding to close
the polemical p&acirc;da with a defence of that doctrine
which&mdash;in spite of objections&mdash;has to be viewed as the
true one.</p>
<h4>P&Acirc;DA III.</h4>
<p>The third p&acirc;da discusses the question whether the
different forms of existence which, in their totality, constitute
the world have an origin or not, i.e. whether they are co-eternal
with Brahman, or issue from it and are refunded into it at stated
intervals.</p>
<p>The first seven adhikara<i>n</i>as treat of the five elementary
substances.&mdash;Adhik. I (1-7) teaches that the ether is not
co-eternal with Brahman, but springs from it as its first
effect.&mdash;Adhik. II (8) shows that air springs from ether;
Adhik. IV, V, VI (10; 11; 12) that fire springs from air, water
from fire, earth from water.&mdash;Adhik. III (9) explains by way
of digression that Brahman, which is not some special entity, but
quite generally 'that which is,' cannot have originated from
anything else.</p>
<p>Adhik. VII (13) demonstrates that the origination of one element
from another is due, not to the latter in itself, but to Brahman
acting in it.</p>
<p>Adhik. VIII (14) teaches that the reabsorption of the elements
into Brahman takes place in the inverse order of their
emission.</p>
<p>Adhik. IX (15) remarks that the indicated order in which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-53" id=
"pageintro-53"></a>{Intro 53}</span> the emission and the
reabsorption of the elementary substances take place is not
interfered with by the creation and reabsorption of the organs of
the soul, i.e. the sense organs and the internal organ (manas); for
they also are of elemental nature, and as such created and
retracted together with the elements of which they consist.</p>
<p>The remainder of the p&acirc;da is taken up by a discussion of
the nature of the individual soul, the j&icirc;va.&mdash;Adhik. X
(16) teaches that expressions such as 'Devadatta is born,'
'Devadatta has died,' strictly apply to the body only, and are
transferred to the soul in so far only as it is connected with a
body.</p>
<p>Adhik. XI (17) teaches that the individual soul is, according to
Scripture, permanent, eternal, and therefore not, like the ether
and the other elements, produced from Brahman at the time of
creation.&mdash;This S&ucirc;tra is of course commented on in a
very different manner by <i>S</i>a@nkara on the one hand and
R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja on the other. According to the former, the
j&icirc;va is in reality identical&mdash;and as such
co-eternal&mdash;with Brahman; what originates is merely the soul's
connexion with its limiting adjuncts, and that connexion is
moreover illusory.&mdash;According to R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja, the
j&icirc;va is indeed an effect of Brahman, but has existed in
Brahman from all eternity as an individual being and as a mode
(prak&acirc;ra) of Brahman. So indeed have also the material
elements; yet there is an important distinction owing to which the
elements may be said to originate at the time of creation, while
the same cannot be said of the soul. Previously to creation the
material elements exist in a subtle condition in which they possess
none of the qualities that later on render them the objects of
ordinary experience; hence, when passing over into the gross state
at the time of creation, they may be said to originate. The souls,
on the other hand, possess at all times the same essential
qualities, i.e. they are cognizing agents; only, whenever a new
creation takes place, they associate themselves with bodies, and
their intelligence therewith undergoes a certain expansion or
development (vik&acirc;sa); contrasting with the unevolved or
contracted state (sanko<i>k</i>a) <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"pageintro-54" id="pageintro-54"></a>{Intro 54}</span> which
characterised it during the preceding pralaya. But this change is
not a change of essential nature
(svar&ucirc;p&acirc;nyath&acirc;bh&acirc;va) and hence we have to
distinguish the souls as permanent entities from the material
elements which at the time of each creation and reabsorption change
their essential characteristics.</p>
<p>Adhik. XII (18) defines the nature of the individual soul. The
S&ucirc;tra declares that the soul is 'j<i>&ntilde;</i>a.' This
means, according to <i>S</i>a@nkara, that intelligence or knowledge
does not, as the Vai<i>s</i>eshikas teach, constitute a mere
attribute of the soul which in itself is essentially
non-intelligent, but is the very essence of the soul. The soul is
not a knower, but knowledge; not intelligent, but
intelligence.&mdash;R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja, on the other hand,
explains 'j<i>&ntilde;</i>a' by 'j<i>&ntilde;</i>at<i>ri</i>,' i.e.
knower, knowing agent, and considers the S&ucirc;tra to be directed
not only against the Vai<i>s</i>eshikas, but also against those
philosophers who&mdash;like the S&acirc;@nkhyas and the
Ved&acirc;ntins of <i>S</i>a@nkara's school&mdash;maintain that the
soul is not a knowing agent, but pure <i>k</i>aitanya.&mdash;The
wording of the S&ucirc;tra certainly seems to favour
R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja's interpretation; we can hardly imagine that
an author definitely holding the views of <i>S</i>a@nkara should,
when propounding the important dogma of the soul's nature, use the
term j<i>&ntilde;</i>a of which the most obvious interpretation
j<i>&ntilde;</i>&acirc;t<i>ri</i>, not
j<i>&ntilde;</i>&acirc;nam.</p>
<p>Adhik. XIII (19-32) treats the question whether the individual
soul is a<i>n</i>u, i.e. of very minute size, or omnipresent,
all-pervading (sarvagata, vy&acirc;pin). Here, again, we meet with
diametrically opposite views.&mdash;In <i>S</i>a@nkara's opinion
the S&ucirc;tras 19-38 represent the p&ucirc;rvapaksha view,
according to which the j&icirc;va is a<i>n</i>u, while S&ucirc;tra
29 formulates the siddh&acirc;nta, viz. that the j&icirc;va, which
in reality is all-pervading, is spoken of as a<i>n</i>u in some
scriptural passages, because the qualities of the internal
organ&mdash;which itself is a<i>n</i>u&mdash;constitute the essence
of the individual soul as long as the latter is implicated in the
sa<i>m</i>s&acirc;ra.&mdash;According to R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja, on
the other hand, the first S&ucirc;tra of the adhikara<i>n</i>a
gives utterance to the siddh&acirc;nta view, according to which the
soul is of minute size; the S&ucirc;tras 20-25 confirm this view
and refute objections raised against it; while the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="pageintro-55" id="pageintro-55"></a>{Intro
55}</span> S&ucirc;tras 26-29 resume the question already mooted
under S&ucirc;tra 18, viz. in what relation the soul as knowing
agent (j<i>&ntilde;</i>&acirc;t<i>ri</i>) stands to knowledge
(j<i>&ntilde;</i>&acirc;na).&mdash;In order to decide between the
conflicting claims of these two interpretations we must enter into
some details.&mdash;<i>S</i>a@nkara maintains that S&ucirc;tras
19-28 state and enforce a p&ucirc;rvapaksha view, which is finally
refuted in 29. What here strikes us at the outset, is the unusual
length to which the defence of a mere prim&acirc; facie view is
carried; in no other place the S&ucirc;tras take so much trouble to
render plausible what is meant to be rejected in the end, and an
unbiassed reader will certainly feel inclined to think that in
19-28 we have to do, not with the preliminary statement of a view
finally to be abandoned, but with an elaborate bon&acirc; fide
attempt to establish and vindicate an essential dogma of the
system. Still it is not altogether impossible that the
p&ucirc;rvapaksha should here be treated at greater length than
usual, and the decisive point is therefore whether we can, with
<i>S</i>a@nkara, look upon S&ucirc;tra 29 as embodying a refutation
of the p&ucirc;rvapaksha and thus implicitly acknowledging the
doctrine that the individual soul is all-pervading. Now I think
there can be no doubt that <i>S</i>a@nkara's interpretation of the
S&ucirc;tra is exceedingly forced. Literally translated (and
leaving out the non-essential word 'pr&acirc;j<i>&ntilde;</i>avat')
the S&ucirc;tra runs as follows: 'But on account of that quality
(or "those qualities;" or else "on account of the quality&mdash;or
qualities&mdash;of that") being the essence, (there is) that
designation (or "the designation of that").' This <i>S</i>a@nkara
maintains to mean, 'Because the qualities of the buddhi are the
essence of the soul in the sa<i>m</i>s&acirc;ra state, therefore
the soul itself is sometimes spoken of as a<i>n</i>u.' Now, in the
first place, nothing in the context warrants the explanation of the
first 'tat' by buddhi. And&mdash;which is more important&mdash;in
the second place, it is more than doubtful whether on
<i>S</i>a@nkara's own system the qualities of the buddhi&mdash;such
as pleasure, pain, desire, aversion, &amp;c.&mdash;can with any
propriety be said to constitute the essence of the soul even in the
sa<i>m</i>s&acirc;ra state. The essence of the soul in whatever
state, according to <i>S</i>a@nkara's system, is knowledge or
intelligence; whatever is due to its <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"pageintro-56" id="pageintro-56"></a>{Intro 56}</span> association
with the buddhi is non-essential or, more strictly, unreal,
false.</p>
<p>There are no similar difficulties in the way of
R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja's interpretation of the adhikara<i>n</i>a. He
agrees with <i>S</i>a@nkara in the explanation of S&ucirc;tras
19-35, with this difference that he views them as setting forth,
not the p&ucirc;rvapaksha, but the siddh&acirc;nta. S&ucirc;tras
26-28 also are interpreted in a manner not very different from
<i>S</i>a@nkara's, special stress being laid on the distinction
made by Scripture between knowledge as a mere quality and the soul
as a knowing agent, the substratum of knowledge. This discussion
naturally gives rise to the question how it is that Scripture in
some places makes use of the term vij<i>&ntilde;</i>&acirc;na when
meaning the individual soul. The answer is given in S&ucirc;tra 29,
'The soul is designated as knowledge because it has that quality
for its essence,' i.e. because knowledge is the essential
characteristic quality of the soul, therefore the term 'knowledge'
is employed here and there to denote the soul itself. This latter
interpretation gives rise to no doubt whatever. It closely follows
the wording of the text and does not necessitate any forced
supplementation. The 'tu' of the S&ucirc;tra which, according to
<i>S</i>a@nkara, is meant to discard the p&ucirc;rvapaksha, serves
on R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja's view to set aside a previously-raised
objection; an altogether legitimate assumption.</p>
<p>Of the three remaining S&ucirc;tras of the adhikara<i>n</i>a
(30-32), 30 explains, according to <i>S</i>a@nkara, that the soul
may be called a<i>n</i>u, since, as long as it exists in the
sa<i>m</i>s&acirc;ra condition, it is connected with the buddhi.
According to R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja the S&ucirc;tra teaches that the
soul may be called vij<i>&ntilde;</i>&acirc;na because the latter
constitutes its essential quality as long as it
exists.&mdash;S&ucirc;tra 31 intimates, according to
<i>S</i>a@nkara, that in the states of deep sleep, and so on, the
soul is potentially connected with the buddhi, while in the waking
state that connexion becomes actually manifest. The same
S&ucirc;tra, according to R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja, teaches that
j<i>&ntilde;</i>&acirc;t<i>ri</i>tva is properly said to constitute
the soul's essential nature, although it is actually manifested in
some states of the soul only.&mdash;In S&ucirc;tra 32, finally,
<i>S</i>a@nkara sees a statement of the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="pageintro-57" id="pageintro-57"></a>{Intro
57}</span> doctrine that, unless the soul had the buddhi for its
limiting adjunct, it would either be permanently cognizing or
permanently non-cognizing; while, according to
R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja, the S&ucirc;tra means that the soul would
either be permanently cognizing or permanently non-cognizing, if it
were pure knowledge and all-pervading (instead of being
<i>j&ntilde;</i>&acirc;t<i>ri</i> and a<i>n</i>u, as it is in
reality).&mdash;The three S&ucirc;tras can be made to fit in with
either interpretation, although it must be noted that none of them
explicitly refers to the soul's connexion with the buddhi.</p>
<p>Adhik. XIV and XV (33-39; 40) refer to the kart<i>ri</i>tva of
the j&icirc;va, i.e. the question whether the soul is an agent.
S&ucirc;tras 33-39 clearly say that it is such. But as, according
to <i>S</i>a@nkara's system, this cannot be the final
view,&mdash;the soul being essentially non-active, and all action
belonging to the world of up&acirc;dhis,&mdash;he looks upon the
next following S&ucirc;tra (40) as constituting an
adhikara<i>n</i>a by itself, and teaching that the soul is an agent
when connected with the instruments of action, buddhi, &amp;c.,
while it ceases to be so when dissociated from them, 'just as the
carpenter acts in both ways,' i.e. just as the carpenter works as
long as he wields his instruments, and rests after having laid them
aside.&mdash;R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja, perhaps more naturally, does not
separate S&ucirc;tra 40 from the preceding S&ucirc;tras, but
interprets it as follows: Activity is indeed an essential attribute
of the soul; but therefrom it does not follow that the soul is
always actually active, just as the carpenter, even when furnished
with the requisite instruments, may either work or not work, just
as he pleases.</p>
<p>Adhik. XVI (41, 42) teaches that the soul in its activity is
dependent on the Lord who impels it with a view to its former
actions.</p>
<p>Adhik. XVII (43-53) treats of the relation of the individual
soul to Brahman. S&ucirc;tra 43 declares that the individual soul
is a part (a<i>ms</i>a) of Brahman, and the following S&ucirc;tras
show how that relation does not involve either that Brahman is
affected by the imperfections, sufferings, &amp;c. of the souls, or
that one soul has to participate in the experiences of other souls.
The two commentators of course take entirely <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="pageintro-58" id="pageintro-58"></a>{Intro
58}</span> different views of the doctrine that the soul is a part
of Brahman. According to R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja the souls are in
reality parts of Brahman<a id="footnotetag14" name=
"footnotetag14"></a><a href="#footnote14"><sup>14</sup></a>;
according to Sa@nkara the 'a<i>ms</i>a' of the S&ucirc;tra must be
understood to mean 'a<i>ms</i>a iva,' 'a part as it were;' the one
universal indivisible Brahman having no real parts, but appearing
to be divided owing to its limiting adjuncts.&mdash;One S&ucirc;tra
(50) in this adhikara<i>n</i>a calls for special notice. According
to Sa@nkara the words '&acirc;bh&acirc;sa eva <i>k</i>a' mean '(the
soul is) a mere reflection,' which, as the commentators remark, is
a statement of the so-called pratibimbav&acirc;da, i.e. the
doctrine that the so-called individual soul is nothing but the
reflection of the Self in the buddhi; while S&ucirc;tra 43 had
propounded the so-called ava<i>kkh</i>edav&acirc;da, i.e. the
doctrine that the soul is the highest Self in so far as limited by
its adjuncts.&mdash;According to R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja the
&acirc;bh&acirc;sa of the S&ucirc;tra has to be taken in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-59" id=
"pageintro-59"></a>{Intro 59}</span> sense of
hetv&acirc;bh&acirc;sa, a fallacious argument, and the S&ucirc;tra
is explained as being directed against the reasoning of those
Ved&acirc;ntins according to whom the soul is Brahman in so far as
limited by non-real adjuncts<a id="footnotetag15" name=
"footnotetag15"></a><a href="#footnote15"><sup>15</sup></a>.</p>
<h4>P&Acirc;DA IV.</h4>
<p>Adhik. I, II, III (1-4; 5-6; 7) teach that the
pr&acirc;<i>n</i>as (by which generic name are denoted the
buddh&icirc;ndriyas, karmen-driyas, and the manas) spring from
Brahman; are eleven in number; and are of minute size
(a<i>n</i>u).</p>
<p>Adhik. IV, V, VI (8; 9-12; 13) inform us also that the mukhya
pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a, i.e. the vital air, is produced from Brahman;
that it is a principle distinct from air in general and from the
pr&acirc;<i>n</i>as discussed above; and that it is minute
(a<i>n</i>u).</p>
<p>Adhik. VII and VIII (14-16; 17-19) teach that the
pr&acirc;<i>n</i>as are superintended and guided in their activity
by special divinities, and that they are independent principles,
not mere modifications of the mukhya pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a.</p>
<p>Adhik. IX (20-22) declares that the evolution of names and forms
(the n&acirc;mar&ucirc;pavy&acirc;kara<i>n</i>a) is the work, not
of the individual soul, but of the Lord.</p>

<h3>THIRD ADHY&Acirc;YA.</h3>
<h4>P&Acirc;DA I.</h4>
<p>Adhik. I (1-7) teaches that the soul, when passing out of the
body at the time of death, remains invested with the subtle
material elements (bh&ucirc;tas&ucirc;kshma) which serve as an
abode to the pr&acirc;<i>n</i>as attached to the soul.</p>
<p>Adhik. II (8-11) shows that, when the souls of those who had
enjoyed the reward of their good works in the moon descend to the
earth in order to undergo a new embodiment, there cleaves to them a
remainder (anu<i>s</i>aya) of their <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"pageintro-60" id="pageintro-60"></a>{Intro 60}</span> former deeds
which determines the nature of the new embodiment.</p>
<p>Adhik. III (12-21) discusses the fate after death of those whom
their good works do not entitle to pass up to the moon.</p>
<p>Adhik. IV, V, VI (22; 23; 24-27) teach that the subtle bodies of
the souls descending from the moon through the ether, air, &amp;c.,
do not become identical with ether, air, &amp;c., but only like
them; that the entire descent occupies a short time only; and that,
when the souls finally enter into plants and so on, they do not
participate in the life of the latter, but are merely in external
contact with them.</p>
<h4>P&Acirc;DA II.</h4>
<p>Adhik. I (1-6) treats of the soul in the dreaming state.
According to <i>S</i>a@nkara the three first S&ucirc;tras discuss
the question whether the creative activity ascribed to the soul in
some scriptural passages produces things as real as those by which
the waking soul is surrounded, or not; S&ucirc;tra 3 settles the
point by declaring that the creations of the dreaming soul are mere
'M&acirc;y&acirc;,' since they do not fully manifest the character
of real objects. S&ucirc;tra 4 adds that dreams, although mere
M&acirc;y&acirc;, yet have a prophetic quality. S&ucirc;tras 5 and
6 finally reply to the question why the soul, which after all is a
part of the Lord and as such participates in his excellencies,
should not be able to produce in its dreams a real creation, by the
remark that the soul's knowledge and power are obscured by its
connexion with the gross body.</p>
<p>The considerably diverging interpretation given of this
adhikara<i>n</i>a by R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja has the advantage of more
closely connecting the S&ucirc;tras with each other. According to
him the question is not whether the creations of a dream are real
or not, but whether they are the work of the individual soul or of
the Lord acting within the soul. S&ucirc;tras 1 and 2 set forth the
p&ucirc;rvapaksha. The creations of dreams (are the work of the
individual soul); for thus Scripture declares: 'And the followers
of some <i>s</i>&acirc;k&acirc;s declare (the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="pageintro-61" id="pageintro-61"></a>{Intro
61}</span> soul to be) a creator,' &amp;c. The third S&ucirc;tra
states the siddh&acirc;nta view: 'But the creations of dreams are
M&acirc;y&acirc;, i.e. are of a wonderful nature (and as such
cannot be effected by the individual soul), since (in this life)
the nature (of the soul) is not fully manifested.' Concerning the
word 'm&acirc;y&acirc;,' R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja remarks,
'm&acirc;y&acirc;<i>s</i>abdo hy
&acirc;<i>sk</i>aryav&acirc;<i>k</i>&icirc; janaka<i>s</i>ya kule
j&acirc;t&acirc; devam&acirc;yeva nirmit&acirc; ity&acirc;dishu
tath&acirc; dar<i>s</i>an&acirc;t.' The three remaining
S&ucirc;tras are exhibited in the <i>S</i>r&icirc;-bh&acirc;shya in
a different order, the fourth S&ucirc;tra, according to
<i>S</i>a@nkara, being the sixth according to R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja.
S&ucirc;tras 4 and 5 (according to R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja's
numeration) are explained by R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja very much in the
same way as by <i>S</i>a@nkara; but owing to the former's statement
of the subject-matter of the whole adhikara<i>n</i>a they connect
themselves more intimately with the preceding S&ucirc;tras than is
possible on <i>S</i>a@nkara's interpretation. In S&ucirc;tra 6
(s&ucirc;<i>k</i>aka<i>s</i> <i>k</i>&acirc; hi)
R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja sees a deduction from the siddh&acirc;nta of
the adhikara<i>n</i>a, 'Because the images of a dream are produced
by the highest Lord himself, therefore they have prophetic
significance.'</p>
<p>Adhik. II teaches that in the state of deep dreamless sleep the
soul abides within Brahman in the heart.</p>
<p>Adhik. III (9) expounds the reasons entitling us to assume that
the soul awakening from sleep is the same that went to
sleep.&mdash;Adhik. IV (9) explains the nature of a swoon.</p>
<p>Adhik. V (11-21) is, according to <i>S</i>a@nkara, taken up with
the question as to the nature of the highest Brahman in which the
individual soul is merged in the state of deep sleep. S&ucirc;tra
11 declares that twofold characteristics (viz. absence and presence
of distinctive attributes, nirvi<i>s</i>eshatva and
savi<i>s</i>eshatva) cannot belong to the highest Brahman even
through its stations, i.e. its limiting adjuncts; since all
passages which aim at setting forth Brahman's nature declare it to
be destitute of all distinctive attributes.&mdash;The fact,
S&ucirc;tra 12 continues, that in many passages Brahman is spoken
of as possessing distinctive attributes is of no relevancy, since
wherever there are mentioned limiting adjuncts, on which all
distinction depends, it is specially stated <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="pageintro-62" id="pageintro-62"></a>{Intro
62}</span> that Brahman in itself is free from all diversity;
and&mdash;S&ucirc;tra 13 adds&mdash;in some places the assumption
of diversity is specially objected to.&mdash;That Brahman is devoid
of all form (S&ucirc;tra 14), is the pre-eminent meaning of all
Ved&acirc;nta-texts setting forth Brahman's nature.&mdash;That
Brahman is represented as having different forms, as it were, is
due to its connexion with its (unreal) limiting adjuncts; just as
the light of the sun appears straight or crooked, as it were,
according to the nature of the things he illuminates
(15).&mdash;The B<i>ri</i>had&acirc;ra<i>n</i>yaka expressly
declares that Brahman is one uniform mass of intelligence (16); and
the same is taught in other scriptural passages and in
Sm<i>ri</i>ti (l7).&mdash;At the unreality of the apparent
manifoldness of the Self, caused by the limiting adjuncts, aim
those scriptural passages in which the Self is compared to the sun,
which remains one although his reflections on the surface of the
water are many (18).&mdash;Nor must the objection be raised that
that comparison is unsuitable, because the Self is not material
like the sun, and there are no real up&acirc;dhis separate from it
as the water is from the sun; for the comparison merely means to
indicate that, as the reflected image of the sun participates in
the changes, increase, decrease, &amp;c., which the water undergoes
while the sun himself remains unaffected thereby, so the true Self
is not affected by the attributes of the up&acirc;dhis, while, in
so far as it is limited by the latter, it is affected by them as it
were (19, 20).&mdash;That the Self is within the up&acirc;dhis,
Scripture declares (21).</p>
<p>From the above explanation of this important adhikara<i>n</i>a
the one given in the Sr&icirc;-bh&acirc;shya differs totally.
According to R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja the adhikara<i>n</i>a raises the
question whether the imperfections clinging to the individual soul
(the discussion of which has now come to an end) affect also the
highest Lord who, according to Scripture, abides within the soul as
antary&acirc;min. 'Notwithstanding the abode (of the highest Self
within the soul) (it is) not (affected by the soul's imperfections)
because everywhere (the highest Self is represented) as having
twofold characteristics (viz. being, on one hand, free from all
evil, apahatap&acirc;pman, vijara, vim<i>ri</i>tyu, &amp;c., and,
on the other hand, endowed with all auspicious <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="pageintro-63" id="pageintro-63"></a>{Intro
63}</span> qualities, satyak&acirc;ma, satyasa<i>m</i>kalpa,
&amp;c.) (11).&mdash;Should it be objected that, just as the soul
although essentially free from evil&mdash;according to the
Praj&acirc;pativ&acirc;kya in the Ch&acirc;ndogya&mdash;yet is
liable to imperfections owing to its connexion with a variety of
bodies, so the antary&acirc;min also is affected by abiding within
bodies; we deny this because in every section of the chapter
referring to the antary&acirc;min (in the
B<i>ri</i>had&acirc;ra<i>n</i>yaka) he is expressly called the
Immortal, the ruler within; which shows him to be free from the
shortcomings of the jiva (12).&mdash;Some, moreover, expressly
assert that, although the Lord and the soul are within one body,
the soul only is imperfect, not the Lord (dv&acirc;
supar<i>n</i>&acirc; sayuj&acirc; sakh&acirc;y&acirc;)
(13).&mdash;Should it be said that, according to the
Ch&acirc;ndogya, Brahman entered together with the souls into the
elements previously to the evolution of names and forms, and hence
participates in the latter, thus becoming implicated in the
sa<i>m</i>s&aacute;ra; we reply that Brahman, although connected
with such and such forms, is in itself devoid of form, since it is
the principal element (agent; pradh&acirc;na) in the bringing about
of names and forms (according to '&acirc;k&acirc;<i>s</i>o ha vai
n&acirc;mar&ucirc;payor nirvahit&acirc;') (14).&mdash;But does not
the passage 'satya<i>m</i> j<i>&ntilde;</i>&acirc;nam anantam
brahma' teach that Brahman is nothing but light (intelligence)
without any difference, and does not the passage 'neti neti' deny
of it all qualities?&mdash;As in order, we reply, not to deprive
passages as the one quoted from the Taittir&icirc;ya of their
purport, we admit that Brahman's nature is light, so we must also
admit that Brahman is satyasa<i>m</i>kalpa, and so on; for if not,
the passages in which those qualities are asserted would become
purportless (15).&mdash;Moreover the Taittir&icirc;ya passage only
asserts so much, viz. the prak&acirc;<i>s</i>ar&ucirc;pat&acirc; of
Brahman, and does not deny other qualities (l6).&mdash;And the
passage 'neti neti' will be discussed later on.&mdash;The
ubhayali@ngatva of Brahman in the sense assigned above is asserted
in many places <i>S</i>ruti and Sm<i>ri</i>ti (17).&mdash;Because
Brahman although abiding in many places is not touched by their
imperfections, the similes of the reflected sun, of the ether
limited by jars, &amp;c., are applicable to it (18).&mdash;Should
it be said that the illustration is not an appropriate one, because
the <span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-64" id=
"pageintro-64"></a>{Intro 64}</span> sun is apprehended in the
water erroneously only while the antary&acirc;min really abides
within all things, and therefore must be viewed as sharing their
defects (19); we reply that what the simile means to negative is
merely that Brahman should, owing to its inherence in many places,
participate in the increase, decrease, and so on, of its abodes. On
this view both similes are appropriate (20).&mdash;Analogous
similes we observe to be employed in ordinary life, as when we
compare a man to a lion (21).</p>
<p>S&ucirc;tras 22-30 constitute, according to <i>S</i>a@nkara, a
new adhikara<i>n</i>a (VI), whose object it is to show that the
clause 'not so, not so' (neti neti; B<i>ri</i>had&acirc;r)
negatives, not Brahman itself, but only the two forms of Brahman
described in the preceding part of the chapter. S&ucirc;tras 23-26
further dwell on Brahman being in reality devoid of all distinctive
attributes which are altogether due to the up&acirc;dhis. The last
four S&ucirc;tras return to the question how, Brahman being one
only, the souls are in so many places spoken of as different from
it, and, two explanatory hypotheses having been rejected, the
conclusion is arrived at that all difference is unreal, due to
fictitious limiting adjuncts.</p>
<p>According to R&aacute;m&acirc;nuja, S&ucirc;tras 22 ff. continue
the discussion started in S&ucirc;tra 11. How, the question is
asked, can the ubhayali@ngatva of Brahman be maintained considering
that the 'not so, not so' of the B<i>ri</i>had&acirc;ra<i>n</i>yaka
denies of Brahman all the previously mentioned modes
(prak&acirc;ra), so that it can only be called that which is
(sanm&acirc;tra)?&mdash;The reply given in S&ucirc;tra 22 is that
'not so, not so' does not deny of Brahman the distinctive qualities
or modes declared previously (for it would be senseless at first to
teach them, and finally to deny them again<a id="footnotetag16"
name="footnotetag16"></a><a href="#footnote16"><sup>16</sup></a>),
but merely denies the pr&acirc;k<i>ri</i>tait&acirc;vattva, the
previously stated limited nature of Brahman, i.e. it denies that
Brahman possesses only the previously mentioned qualifications.
With this agrees, that subsequently to 'neti neti' Scripture itself
enunciates further qualifications of Brahman. That Brahman as
stated <span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-65" id=
"pageintro-65"></a>{Intro 65}</span> above is not the object of any
other means of proof but Scripture is confirmed in S&ucirc;tra 23,
'Scripture declares Brahman to be the non-manifest.'&mdash;And the
intuition (s&aacute;ksh&acirc;tkk&acirc;ra) of Brahman ensues only
upon its sa<i>m</i>r&acirc;dhana, i.e. upon its being perfectly
pleased by the worshipper's devotion, as Scripture and
Sm<i>ri</i>ti declare (24).&mdash;That this interpretation of
'neti' is the right one, is likewise shown by the fact that in the
same way as prak&acirc;<i>s</i>a, luminousness,
j<i>&ntilde;</i>&acirc;na, intelligence, &amp;c., so also the
quality of being differentiated by the world
(prapa<i>&ntilde;k</i>avsish<i>t</i>at&acirc;) is intuited as
non-different, i.e. as likewise qualifying Brahman; and that
prak&acirc;<i>s</i>a, and so on, characterise Brahman, is known
through repeated practice (on the part of <i>ri</i>shis like
V&acirc;madeva) in the work of sa<i>m</i>r&acirc;dhana mentioned
before (25).&mdash;For all these reasons Brahman is connected with
the infinite, i.e. the infinite number of auspicious qualities; for
thus the twofold indications (li@nga) met with in Scripture are
fully justified (26).&mdash;In what relation, then, does the
a<i>k</i>id vastu, i.e. the non-sentient matter, which, according
to the b<i>ri</i>hadara<i>n</i>yaka, is one of the forms of
Brahman, stand to the latter?&mdash;Non-sentient beings might, in
the first place, be viewed as special arrangements
(sa<i>m</i>sthanavisesh&acirc;<i>h</i>) of Brahman, as the coils
are of the body of the snake; for Brahman is designated as both,
i.e. sometimes as one with the world (Brahman is all this,
&amp;c.), sometimes as different from it (Let me enter into those
elements, &amp;c.) (27).&mdash;Or, in the second place, the
relation of the two might be viewed as analogous to that of light
and the luminous object which are two and yet one, both being fire
(28).&mdash;Or, in the third place, the relation is like that
stated before, i.e. the material world is, like the individual
souls (whose case was discussed in II, 3, 43), a
part&mdash;a<i>ms</i>a&mdash;of Brahman (29, 30).</p>
<p>Adhik. VII (31-37) explains how some metaphorical expressions,
seemingly implying that there is something different from Brahman,
have to be truly understood.</p>
<p>Adhik. VIII (38-41) teaches that the reward of works is not, as
Jaimini opines, the independent result of the works acting through
the so-called ap&ucirc;rva, but is allotted by the Lord.</p>

<h4>P&Acirc;DA III.</h4>
<p>With the third p&acirc;da of the second adhy&acirc;ya a new
section of the work begins, whose task it is to describe how the
individual soul is enabled by meditation on Brahman to obtain final
release. The first point to be determined here is what constitutes
a meditation on Brahman, and, more particularly, in what relation
those parts of the Upanishads stand to each other which enjoin
identical or partly identical meditations. The reader of the
Upanishads cannot fail to observe that the texts of the different
<i>s</i>&acirc;kh&acirc;s contain many chapters of similar, often
nearly identical, contents, and that in some cases the text of even
one and the same <i>s</i>&acirc;kh&acirc; exhibits the same matter
in more or less varied forms. The reason of this clearly is that
the common stock of religious and philosophical ideas which were in
circulation at the time of the composition of the Upanishads found
separate expression in the different priestly communities; hence
the same speculations, legends, &amp;c. reappear in various places
of the sacred Scriptures in more or less differing dress.
Originally, when we may suppose the members of each Vedic school to
have confined themselves to the study of their own sacred texts,
the fact that the texts of other schools contained chapters of
similar contents would hardly appear to call for special note or
comment; not any more than the circumstance that the sacrificial
performances enjoined on the followers of some particular
<i>s</i>&acirc;kh&acirc; were found described with greater or
smaller modifications in the books of other
<i>s</i>&acirc;kh&acirc;s also. But already at a very early period,
at any rate long before the composition of the
Ved&acirc;nta-s&ucirc;tras in their present form, the Vedic
theologians must have apprehended the truth that, in whatever
regards sacrificial acts, one <i>s</i>&acirc;kh&acirc; may indeed
safely follow its own texts, disregarding the texts of all other
<i>s</i>&acirc;kh&acirc;s; that, however, all texts which aim at
throwing light on the nature of Brahman and the relation to it of
the human soul must somehow or other be combined into one
consistent systematical whole equally valid for the followers of
all Vedic schools. For, as we have had occasion to remark above,
while acts may be performed <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"pageintro-67" id="pageintro-67"></a>{Intro 67}</span> by different
individuals in different ways, cognition is defined by the nature
of the object cognised, and hence can be one only, unless it ceases
to be true cognition. Hence the attempts, on the one hand, of
discarding by skilful interpretation all contradictions met with in
the sacred text, and, on the other hand, of showing what sections
of the different Upanishads have to be viewed as teaching the same
matter, and therefore must be combined in one meditation. The
latter is the special task of the present p&acirc;da.</p>
<p>Adhik. I and II (1-4; 5) are concerned with the question whether
those vidy&acirc;s, which are met with in identical or similar form
in more than one sacred text, are to be considered as constituting
several vidy&acirc;s, or one vidy&acirc; only. <i>S</i>a@nkara
remarks that the question affects only those vidy&acirc;s whose
object is the qualified Brahman; for the knowledge of the
non-qualified Brahman, which is of an absolutely uniform nature,
can of course be one only wherever it is set forth. But things lie
differently in those cases where the object of knowledge is the
sagu<i>n</i>am brahma or some outward manifestation of Brahman; for
the qualities as well as manifestations of Brahman are many.
Anticipating the subject of a later adhikara<i>n</i>a, we may take
for an example the so-called
<i>S</i>&acirc;<i>nd</i>ilyavidy&acirc; which is met with in Ch.
Up. III, 14, again&mdash;in an abridged form&mdash;in B<i>ri</i>.
Up. V, 6, and, moreover, in the tenth book of the
<i>S</i>atapathabr&aacute;hma<i>n</i>a (X, 6, 3). The three
passages enjoin a meditation on Brahman as possessing certain
attributes, some of which are specified in all the three texts (as,
for instance, manomayatva, bh&acirc;r&ucirc;patva), while others
are peculiar to each separate passage
(pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a<i>s</i>ar&icirc;ratva and
satyasa<i>m</i>kalpatva, for instance, being mentioned in the
Ch&acirc;ndogya Upanishad and
<i>S</i>atapatha-br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a, but not in the
B<i>ri</i>had&acirc;ra<i>n</i>yaka Upanishad, which, on its part,
specifies sarvava<i>s</i>itva, not referred to in the two other
texts). Here, then, there is room for a doubt whether the three
passages refer to one object of knowledge or not. To the devout
Ved&acirc;ntin the question is not a purely theoretical one, but of
immediate practical interest. For if the three texts are to be held
apart, there are three different meditations to be gone through;
if, on the <span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-68" id=
"pageintro-68"></a>{Intro 68}</span> other hand, the vidy&acirc; is
one only, all the different qualities of Brahman mentioned in the
three passages have to be combined into one meditation.&mdash;The
decision is here, as in all similar cases, in favour of the latter
alternative. A careful examination of the three passages shows that
the object of meditation is one only; hence the meditation also is
one only, comprehending all the attributes mentioned in the three
texts.</p>
<p>Adhik. III (6-8) discusses the case of vidy&acirc;s being really
separate, although apparently identical. The examples selected are
the udg&icirc;thavidy&acirc;s of the Ch&acirc;ndogya Upanishad (I,
1-3) and the B<i>ri</i>had&acirc;ra<i>n</i>yaka Upanishad (I, 3),
which, although showing certain similarities&mdash;such as bearing
the same name and the udg&icirc;tha being in both identified with
pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a&mdash;yet are to be held apart, because the
subject of the Ch&acirc;ndogya vidy&acirc; is not the whole
udg&icirc;tha but only the sacred syllabic Om, while the
B<i>ri</i>had&acirc;ra<i>n</i>yaka Upanishad represents the whole
udg&icirc;tha as the object of meditation.</p>
<p>S&ucirc;tra 9 constitutes in <i>S</i>a@nkara's view a new
adhikara<i>n</i>a (IV), proving that in the passage, 'Let a man
meditate' (Ch. Up. I, 1, 1), the O<i>m</i>k&acirc;ra and the
udg&icirc;tha stand in the relation of one specifying the other,
the meaning being, 'Let a man meditate on that O<i>m</i>k&acirc;ra
which,' &amp;c.&mdash;According to R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja's
interpretation, which seems to fall in more satisfactorily with the
form and the wording of the S&ucirc;tra, the latter merely
furnishes an additional argument for the conclusion arrived at in
the preceding adhikara<i>n</i>a.&mdash;Adhik. V (10) determines the
unity of the so-called pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a-vidy&acirc;s and the
consequent comprehension of the different qualities of the
pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a, which are mentioned in the different texts,
within one meditation.</p>
<p>Adhik. VI comprises, according to <i>S</i>a@nkara, the
S&ucirc;tras 11-13. The point to be settled is whether in all the
meditations on Brahman all its qualities are to be included or only
those mentioned in the special vidy&acirc;. The decision is that
the essential and unalterable attributes of Brahman, such as bliss
and knowledge, are to be taken into account everywhere, while those
which admit of a more or less (as, for instance, the attribute of
having joy for its head, mentioned <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"pageintro-69" id="pageintro-69"></a>{Intro 69}</span> in the
Taitt. Up.) are confined to special meditations.&mdash;Adhik. VII
(14, 15), according to <i>S</i>a@nkara, aims at proving that the
object of Ka<i>th</i>a. Up. III, 10, 11 is one only, viz. to show
that the highest Self is higher than everything, so that the
passage constitutes one vidy&acirc; only.&mdash;Adhik. VIII (16,
17) determines, according to <i>S</i>a@nkara, that the Self spoken
of in Ait. &Acirc;r. II, 4, 1, 1 is not a lower form of the Self
(the so-called s&ucirc;tr&acirc;tman), but the highest Self; the
discussion of that point in this place being due to the wish to
prove that the attributes of the highest Self have to be
comprehended in the Aitarcyaka meditation.</p>
<p>According to R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja the S&ucirc;tras 11-17
constitute a single adhikara<i>n</i>a whose subject is the same as
that of <i>S</i>a@nkara's sixth adhikar<i>n</i>a. S&ucirc;tras
11-13 are, on the whole, explained as by <i>S</i>a@nkara;
S&ucirc;tra 12, however, is said to mean, 'Such attributes as
having joy for its head, &amp;c. are not to be viewed as qualities
of Brahman, and therefore not to be included in every meditation;
for if they were admitted as qualities, difference would be
introduced into Brahman's nature, and that would involve a more or
less on Brahman's part.' S&ucirc;tras 14-17 continue the discussion
of the passage about the priya<i>s</i>irastva.&mdash;If
priya<i>s</i>irastva, &amp;c. are not to be viewed as real
qualities of Brahman, for what purpose does the text mention
them?&mdash;'Because,' S&ucirc;tra 14 replies, 'there is no other
purpose, Scripture mentions them for the purpose of pious
meditation.'&mdash;But how is it known that the Self of delight is
the highest Self? (owing to which you maintain that having limbs,
head, &amp;c. cannot belong to it as attributes.)&mdash;'Because,'
S&ucirc;tra 15 replies, 'the term "Self" (&acirc;tm&acirc;
&acirc;nandamaya) is applied to it.'&mdash;But in the previous
parts of the chapter the term Self (in &acirc;tma pra<i>n</i>amaya,
&amp;c.) is applied to non-Selfs also; how then do you know that in
&acirc;tm&acirc; &acirc;nandamaya it denotes the real
Self?&mdash;'The term Self,' S&ucirc;tra 16 replies, 'is employed
here to denote the highest Self as in many other passages
(&acirc;tma&acirc; v&acirc; idam eka, &amp;c.), as we conclude from
the subsequent passage, viz. he wished, May I be many.'&mdash;But,
an objection is raised, does not the context show that the term
'Self,' which in all the preceding <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"pageintro-70" id="pageintro-70"></a>{Intro 70}</span> clauses
about the pr&acirc;<i>n</i>amaya, &amp;c. denoted something other
than the Self, does the same in &acirc;nandamaya &acirc;tman, and
is not the context of greater weight than a subsequent
passage?&mdash;To this question asked in the former half of 17
(anvay&acirc;d iti <i>k</i>et) the latter half replies, 'Still it
denotes the Self, owing to the affirmatory statement,' i.e. the
fact of the highest Self having been affirmed in a previous passage
also, viz. II, 1, 'From that Self sprang ether.'</p>
<p>Adhik. IX (18) discusses a minor point connected with the
pr&acirc;<i>n</i>asa<i>m</i>v&acirc;da.&mdash;The subject of Adhik.
X (19) has been indicated already above under Adhik.
I.&mdash;Adhik. XI (20-22) treats of a case of a contrary nature;
in B<i>ri</i>. Up. V, 5, Brahman is represented first as abiding in
the sphere of the sun, and then as abiding within the eye; we
therefore, in spite of certain counter-indications, have to do with
two separate vidy&acirc;s.&mdash;Adhik. XII (23) refers to a
similar case; certain attributes of Brahman mentioned in the
R&acirc;<i>n</i>&acirc;yan&icirc;ya-khila have not to be introduced
into the corresponding Ch&acirc;ndogya vidy&acirc;, because the
stated difference of Brahman's abode involves difference of
vidy&acirc;.&mdash;Adhik. XIII (24) treats of another instance of
two vidyas having to be held apart.</p>
<p>Adhik. XIV (25) decides that certain detached mantras and
br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a passages met with in the beginning of some
Upanishads&mdash;as, for instance, a br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a about
the mah&acirc;vrata ceremony at the beginning of the
Aitareya-&acirc;ra<i>n</i>yaka&mdash;do, notwithstanding their
position which seems to connect them with the brahmavidy&acirc;,
not belong to the latter, since they show unmistakable signs of
being connected with sacrificial acts.</p>
<p>Adhik. XV (26) treats of the passages stating that the man dying
in the possession of true knowledge shakes off all his good and
evil deeds, and affirms that a statement, made in some of those
passages only, to the effect that the good and evil deeds pass over
to the friends and enemies of the deceased, is valid for all the
passages.</p>
<p>S&ucirc;tras 27-30 constitute, according to <i>S</i>a@nkara, two
adhikara<i>n</i>as of which the former (XVI; 27, 28) decides that
the shaking off of the good and evil deeds takes place&mdash;not,
as <span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-71" id=
"pageintro-71"></a>{Intro 71}</span> the Kaush. Up. states, on the
road to Brahman's world&mdash;but at the moment of the soul's
departure from the body; the Kaushitaki statement is therefore not
to be taken literally.&mdash;The latter adhikara<i>n</i>a (XVII;
29, 30) treats of the cognate question whether the soul that has
freed itself from its deeds proceeds in all cases on the road of
the gods (as said in the Kaush. Up.), or not. The decision is that
he only whose knowledge does not pass beyond the sagu<i>n</i>am
brahma proceeds on that road, while the soul of him who knows the
nirgu<i>n</i>am brahma becomes one with it without moving to any
other place.</p>
<p>The <i>S</i>r&icirc;-bh&acirc;shya treats the four S&ucirc;tras
as one adhikara<i>n</i>a whose two first S&ucirc;tras are explained
as by <i>S</i>a@nkara, while S&ucirc;tra 29 raises an objection to
the conclusion arrived at, 'the going (of the soul on the path of
the gods) has a sense only if the soul's freeing itself from its
works takes place in both ways, i.e. partly at the moment of death,
partly on the road to Brahman; for otherwise there would be a
contradiction' (the contradiction being that, if the soul's works
were all shaken off at the moment of death, the subtle body would
likewise perish at that moment, and then the bodiless soul would be
unable to proceed on the path of the gods). To this S&ucirc;tra 30
replies, 'The complete shaking off of the works at the moment of
death is possible, since matters of that kind are observed in
Scripture,' i.e. since scriptural passages show that even he whose
works are entirely annihilated, and who has manifested himself in
his true shape, is yet connected with some kind of body; compare
the passage, 'para<i>m</i> jyotir upasampadya svena
r&ucirc;pe<i>n</i>abhinishpadyate sa tatra paryeti
kr&icirc;<i>d</i>an ramam&acirc;na<i>h</i> sa svar&acirc;<i>d</i>
bhavati tasya sarveshu lokeshu k&acirc;ma<i>k</i>&acirc;ro
bhavati.' That subtle body is not due to karman, but to the soul's
vidy&acirc;m&acirc;h&acirc;tmya.&mdash;That the explanation of the
<i>S</i>r&icirc;-bh&acirc;shya agrees with the text as well as
<i>S</i>a@nkara's, a comparison of the two will show; especially
forced is <i>S</i>a@nkara's explanation of 'arthavattvam
ubhayath&acirc;,' which is said to mean that there is arthavattva
in one case, and non-arthavattva in the other case.</p>
<p>The next S&ucirc;tra (31) constitutes an adhikara<i>n</i>a
(XVIII) <span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-72" id=
"pageintro-72"></a>{Intro 72}</span> deciding that the road of the
gods is followed not only by those knowing the vidy&acirc;s which
specially mention the going on that road, but by all who are
acquainted with the sagu<i>n</i>a-vidy&acirc;s of
Brahman.&mdash;The explanation given in the
<i>S</i>r&icirc;-bh&acirc;shya (in which S&ucirc;tras 31 and 32
have exchanged places) is similar, with the difference however that
all who meditate on Brahman&mdash;without any reference to the
distinction of nirgu<i>n</i>a and sagu<i>n</i>a&mdash;proceed after
death on the road of the gods. (The <i>S</i>r&icirc;-bh&acirc;shya
reads 'sarvesh&acirc;m,' i.e. all worshippers, not
'sarv&acirc;s&acirc;m,' all sagu<i>n</i>a-vidy&acirc;s.)</p>
<p>Adhik. XIX (32) decides that, although the general effect of
true knowledge is release from all forms of body, yet even such
beings as have reached perfect knowledge may retain a body for the
purpose of discharging certain offices.&mdash;In the
<i>S</i>r&icirc;-bh&acirc;shya, where the S&ucirc;tra follows
immediately on S&ucirc;tra 30, the adhikara<i>n</i>a determines, in
close connexion with 30, that, although those who know Brahman as a
rule divest themselves of the gross body&mdash;there remaining only
a subtle body which enables them to move&mdash;and no longer
experience pleasure and pain, yet certain beings, although having
reached the cognition of Brahman, remain invested with a gross
body, and hence liable to pleasure and pain until they have fully
performed certain duties.</p>
<p>Adhik. XX (33) teaches that the negative attributes of Brahman
mentioned in some vidy&acirc;s&mdash;such as its being not gross,
not subtle, &amp;c.&mdash;are to be included in all meditations on
Brahman.&mdash;Adhik. XXI (34) determines that K&acirc;<i>th</i>a
Up. III, 1, and Mu. Up. III, 1, constitute one vidy&acirc; only,
because both passages refer to the highest Brahman. According to
R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja the S&ucirc;tra contains a reply to an
objection raised against the conclusion arrived at in the preceding
S&ucirc;tra.&mdash;Adhik. XXII (35, 36) maintains that the two
passages, B<i>ri</i>. Up. III, 4 and III, 5, constitute one
vidy&acirc; only, the object of knowledge being in both cases
Brahman viewed as the inner Self of all.&mdash;Adhik. XXIII (37) on
the contrary decides that the passage Ait. &Acirc;r. II, 2, 4, 6
constitutes not one but two meditations.&mdash;Adhik. XXIV (38)
again determines that the vidy&acirc; of the True contained in
B<i>ri</i>. Up. V, 4, 5, is one only&mdash;According to
R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja, <span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-73"
id="pageintro-73"></a>{Intro 73}</span> S&ucirc;tras 35-38
constitute one adhikara<i>n</i>a only whose subject is the same as
that of XXII according to <i>S</i>a@nkara.</p>
<p>Adhik. XXV (39) proves that the passages Ch. Up. VIII, 1 and
B<i>ri</i>. Up. IV, 4, 22 cannot constitute one vidy&acirc;, since
the former refers to Brahman as possessing qualities, while the
latter is concerned with Brahman as destitute of
qualities.&mdash;Adhik. XXVI (40, 41) treats, according to
<i>S</i>a@nkara, of a minor question connected with Ch. Up. V, 11
ff.&mdash;According to the <i>S</i>r&icirc;-bh&acirc;shya,
S&ucirc;tras 39-41 form one adhikara<i>n</i>a whose first
S&ucirc;tra reaches essentially the same conclusion as
<i>S</i>a@nkara under 39. S&ucirc;tras 40, 41 thereupon discuss a
general question concerning the meditations on Brahman. The
qualities, an opponent is supposed to remark, which in the two
passages discussed are predicated of Brahman&mdash;such as
va<i>s</i>itva, satyak&acirc;matva, &amp;c.&mdash;cannot be
considered real (p&acirc;ram&acirc;rthika), since other passages
(sa esha neti neti, and the like) declare Brahman to be devoid of
all qualities. Hence those qualities cannot be admitted into
meditations whose purpose is final release.&mdash;To this objection
S&ucirc;tra 40 replies, '(Those qualities) are not to be left off
(from the meditations on Brahman), since (in the passage under
discussion as well as in other passages) they are stated with
emphasis<a id="footnotetag17" name="footnotetag17"></a><a href=
"#footnote17"><sup>17</sup></a>.'&mdash;But, another objection is
raised, Scripture says that he who meditates on Brahman as
satyak&acirc;ma, &amp;c. obtains a mere perishable reward, viz. the
world of the fathers, and similar results specified in Ch. Up.
VIII, 2; hence, he who is desirous of final release, must not
include those qualities of Brahman in his meditation.&mdash;To this
objection S&ucirc;tra 41 replies, 'Because that (i.e. the free
roaming in all the worlds, the world of the fathers, &amp;c.) is
stated as proceeding therefrom (i.e. the approach to Brahman which
is final release) in the case of (the soul) which has approached
Brahman;' (therefore a person desirous of release, may include
satyak&acirc;matva, &amp;c. in his meditations.)</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-74" id=
"pageintro-74"></a>{Intro 74}</span>
<p>Adhik. XXVII (42) decides that those meditations which are
connected with certain matters forming constituent parts of
sacrificial actions, are not to be considered as permanently
requisite parts of the latter.&mdash;Adhik. XXVIII (43) teaches
that, in a B<i>ri</i>. Up. passage and a similar Ch. Up. passage,
V&acirc;yu and Pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a are not to be identified, but to
be held apart.&mdash;Adhik. XXIX (44-52) decides that the
firealtars made of mind, &amp;c., which are mentioned in the
Agnirahasya, do not constitute parts of the sacrificial action (so
that the mental, &amp;c. construction of the altar could optionally
be substituted for the actual one), but merely subjects of
meditations.</p>
<p>Adhik. XXX (53, 54) treats, according to <i>S</i>a@nkara, in the
way of digression, of the question whether to the Self an existence
independent of the body can be assigned, or not (as the
Materialists maintain).&mdash;According to the
<i>S</i>r&icirc;-bh&acirc;shya the adhikara<i>n</i>a does not refer
to this wide question, but is concerned with a point more
immediately connected with the meditations on Brahman, viz. the
question as to the form under which, in those meditations, the Self
of the meditating devotee has to be viewed. The two S&ucirc;tras
then have to be translated as follows: 'Some (maintain that the
soul of the devotee has, in meditations, to be viewed as possessing
those attributes only which belong to it in its embodied state,
such as j<i>&ntilde;</i>at<i>ri</i>tva and the like), because the
Self is (at the time of meditation) in the body.'&mdash;The next
S&ucirc;tra rejects this view, 'This is not so, but the
separatedness (i.e. the pure isolated state in which the Self is at
the time of final release when it is freed from all evil, &amp;c.)
(is to be transferred to the meditating Self), because that will
be<a id="footnotetag18" name="footnotetag18"></a><a href=
"#footnote18"><sup>18</sup></a> the state (of the Self in the
condition of final release).'</p>
<p>Adhik. XXXI (55, 56) decides that meditations connected with
constituent elements of the sacrifice, such as the udgitha, are, in
spite of difference of svara in the udgitha, &amp;c., valid, not
only for that <i>s</i>&acirc;kh&acirc; in which the meditation
actually is met with, but for all
<i>s</i>&acirc;kh&acirc;s.&mdash;Adhik. <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="pageintro-75" id="pageintro-75"></a>{Intro
75}</span> XXXII (57) decides that the Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara Agni
of Ch. Up. V, 11 ff. is to be meditated upon as a whole, not in his
single parts.&mdash;Adhik. XXXIII (58) teaches that those
meditations which refer to one subject, but as distinguished by
different qualities, have to be held apart as different
meditations. Thus the daharavidy&acirc;,
<i>S</i>a<i>nd</i>ilyavidy&acirc;, &amp;c. remain separate.</p>
<p>Adhik. XXXIV (59) teaches that those meditations on Brahman for
which the texts assign one and the same fruit are optional, there
being no reason for their being cumulated.&mdash;Adhik. XXXV (60)
decides that those meditations, on the other hand, which refer to
special wishes may be cumulated or optionally employed according to
choice.&mdash;Adhik. XXXVI (61-66) extends this conclusion to the
meditations connected with constituent elements of action, such as
the udg&icirc;tha.</p>
<h4>P&Acirc;DA IV.</h4>
<p>Adhik. I (1-17) proves that the knowledge of Brahman is not
kratvartha, i.e. subordinate to action, but
independent.&mdash;Adhik. II (18-20) confirms this conclusion by
showing that the state of the pravr&acirc;jins is enjoined by the
sacred law, and that for them vidy&acirc; only is prescribed, not
action.&mdash;Adhik. III (21, 22) decides that certain clauses
forming part of vidy&acirc;s are not mere stutis
(arthav&acirc;das), but themselves enjoin the meditation.&mdash;The
legends recorded in the Ved&acirc;nta-texts are not to be used as
subordinate members of acts, but have the purpose of
glorifying&mdash;as arthav&acirc;das&mdash;the injunctions with
which they are connected (Adhik. IV, 23, 24).&mdash;For all these
reasons the &ucirc;rdhvaretasa<i>h</i> require no actions but only
knowledge (Adhik. V, 25).&mdash;Nevertheless the actions enjoined
by Scripture, such as sacrifices, conduct of certain kinds,
&amp;c., are required as conducive to the rise of vidy&acirc; in
the mind (Adhik. VI, 26, 27).&mdash;Certain relaxations, allowed by
Scripture, of the laws regarding food, are meant only for cases of
extreme need (Adhik. VII, 28-3l).&mdash;The
&acirc;<i>s</i>ramakarm&acirc;<i>n</i>i are obligatory on him also
who does not strive after mukti (Adhik. VIII, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="pageintro-76" id="pageintro-76"></a>{Intro
76}</span> 32-35).&mdash;Those also who, owing to poverty and so
on, are an&acirc;<i>s</i>rama have claims to vidy&acirc; (Adhik.
IX, 36-39).&mdash;An &ucirc;rdhvaretas cannot revoke his vow
(Adhik. X, 40).&mdash;Expiation of the fall of an &ucirc;rdhvaretas
(Adhik. XI, 41, 42).&mdash;Exclusion of the fallen
&ucirc;rdhvaretas in certain cases (Adhik. XII, 43).&mdash;Those
meditations, which are connected with subordinate members of the
sacrifice, are the business of the priest, not of the
yajam&acirc;na (Adhik. XIII, 44-46).&mdash;B<i>ri</i>. Up. III, 5,
1 enjoins mauna as a third in addition to b&acirc;lya and
p&acirc;<i>nd</i>itya (Adhik. XIV, 47-49).&mdash;By b&acirc;lya is
to be understood a childlike innocent state of mind (Adhik. XV,
50).</p>
<p>S&ucirc;tras 51 and 52 discuss, according to
R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja, the question when the vidy&acirc;, which is
the result of the means described in III, 4, arises. S&ucirc;tra 51
treats of that vidy&acirc; whose result is mere exaltation
(abhyudaya), and states that 'it takes place in the present life,
if there is not present an obstacle in the form of a
prabalakarm&acirc;ntara (in which latter case the vidy&acirc;
arises later only), on account of Scripture declaring this (in
various passages).'&mdash;S&ucirc;tra 52, 'Thus there is also
absence of a definite rule as to (the time of origination of) that
knowledge whose fruit is release, it being averred concerning that
one also that it is in the same condition (i.e. of sometimes having
an obstacle, sometimes not).'&mdash;<i>S</i>a@nkara, who treats the
two S&ucirc;tras as two adhikara<i>n</i>as, agrees as to the
explanation of 51, while, putting a somewhat forced interpretation
on 52, he makes it out to mean that a more or less is possible only
in the case of the sagu<i>n</i>a-vidy&acirc;s.</p>

<h3>FOURTH ADHY&Acirc;YA.</h3>
<h4>P&Acirc;DA I.</h4>
<p>Adhikara<i>n</i>a I (1, 2).&mdash;The meditation on the
&Acirc;tman enjoined by Scripture is not an act to be accomplished
once only, but is to be repeated again and again.</p>
<p>Adhik. II (3).&mdash;The devotee engaged in meditation on
Brahman is to view it as constituting his own Self.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-77" id=
"pageintro-77"></a>{Intro 77}</span>
<p>Adhik. III (4).&mdash;To the rule laid down in the preceding
adhikara<i>n</i>a the so-called prat&icirc;kop&acirc;sanas, i.e.
those meditations in which Brahman is viewed under a symbol or
outward manifestation (as, for instance, mano brahmety
up&acirc;s&icirc;ta) constitute an exception, i.e. the devotee is
not to consider the prat&icirc;ka as constituting his own Self.</p>
<p>Adhik. IV (5).&mdash;In the prat&icirc;kop&acirc;sanas the
prat&icirc;ka is to be meditatively viewed as being one with
Brahman, not Brahman as being one with the
prat&icirc;ka.&mdash;R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja takes S&ucirc;tra 5 as
simply giving a reason for the decision arrived at under
S&ucirc;tra 4, and therefore as not constituting a new
adhikara<i>n</i>a.</p>
<p>Adhik. V (6).&mdash;In meditations connected with constitutives
of sacrificial works (as, for instance, ya ev&acirc;sau tapati tam
udg&icirc;tham up&acirc;s&icirc;ta) the idea of the divinity,
&amp;c. is to be transferred to the sacrificial item, not vice
versa. In the example quoted, for instance, the udg&icirc;tha is to
be viewed as &Acirc;ditya, not &Acirc;ditya as the
udg&icirc;tha.</p>
<p>Adhik. VI (7-10).&mdash;The devotee is to carry on his
meditations in a sitting posture.&mdash;<i>S</i>a@nkara maintains
that this rule does not apply to those meditations whose result is
sa<i>m</i>yagdar<i>s</i>ana; but the S&ucirc;tra gives no hint to
that effect.</p>
<p>Adhik. VII (11).&mdash;The meditations may be carried on at any
time, and in any place, favourable to concentration of mind.</p>
<p>Adhik. VIII (12).&mdash;The meditations are to be continued
until death.&mdash;<i>S</i>a@nkara again maintains that those
meditations which lead to sa<i>m</i>yagdar<i>s</i>ana are
excepted.</p>
<p>Adhik. IX (13).&mdash;When through those meditations the
knowledge of Brahman has been reached, the vidv&acirc;n is no
longer affected by the consequences of either past or future evil
deeds.</p>
<p>Adhik. X (14).&mdash;Good deeds likewise lose their
efficiency.&mdash;The literal translation of the S&ucirc;tra is,
'There is likewise non-attachment (to the vidv&acirc;n) of the
other (i.e. of the deeds other than the evil ones, i.e. of good
deeds), but on the fall (of the body, i.e. when death takes
place).' The last words of the S&ucirc;tra, 'but on the fall,' are
separated by <i>S</i>a@nkara from the preceding part of the
S&ucirc;tra and interpreted to mean, 'when death takes place (there
results mukti of <span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-78" id=
"pageintro-78"></a>{Intro 78}</span> the vidv&acirc;n, who through
his knowledge has freed himself from the bonds of
works).'&mdash;According to R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja the whole
S&ucirc;tra simply means, 'There is likewise non-attachment of good
deeds (not at once when knowledge is reached), but on the death of
the vidv&acirc;n<a id="footnotetag19" name=
"footnotetag19"></a><a href="#footnote19"><sup>19</sup></a>.'</p>
<p>Adhik. XI (15).&mdash;The non-operation of works stated in the
two preceding adhikara<i>n</i>as holds good only in the case of
an&acirc;rabdhak&acirc;rya works, i.e. those works which have not
yet begun to produce their effects, while it does not extend to the
&acirc;rabdhak&acirc;rya works on which the present existence of
the devotee depends.</p>
<p>Adhik. XII (16, 17).&mdash;From the rule enunciated in Adhik. X
are excepted such sacrificial performances as are enjoined
permanently (nitya): so, for instance, the agnihotra, for they
promote the origination of knowledge.</p>
<p>Adhik. XIII (18).&mdash;The origination of knowledge is promoted
also by such sacrificial works as are not accompanied with the
knowledge of the up&acirc;sanas referring to the different members
of those works.</p>
<p>Adhik. XIV (19).&mdash;The &acirc;rabdhak&acirc;rya works have
to be worked out fully by the fruition of their effects; whereupon
the vidv&acirc;n becomes united with Brahman.&mdash;The 'bhoga' of
the S&ucirc;tra is, according to <i>S</i>a@nkara, restricted to the
present existence of the devotee, since the complete knowledge
obtained by him destroys the nescience which otherwise would lead
to future embodiments. According to R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja a number
of embodied existences may have to be gone through before the
effects of the &acirc;rabdhak&acirc;rya works are exhausted.</p>
<h4>P&Acirc;DA II.</h4>
<p>This and the two remaining p&acirc;das of the fourth
adhy&acirc;ya describe the fate of the vidv&acirc;n after death.
According to <i>S</i>a@nkara we have to distinguish the
vidv&acirc;n who possesses the highest knowledge, viz. that he is
one with the highest <span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-79"
id="pageintro-79"></a>{Intro 79}</span> Brahman, and the
vidv&acirc;n who knows only the lower Brahman, and have to refer
certain S&ucirc;tras to the former and others to the latter.
According to R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja the vidv&acirc;n is one only.</p>
<p>Adhik. I, II, III (1-6).&mdash;On the death of the vidv&acirc;n
(i.e. of him who possesses the lower knowledge, according to
<i>S</i>a@nkara) his senses are merged in the manas, the manas in
the chief vital air (pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a), the vital air in the
individual soul (j&icirc;va), the soul in the subtle
elements.&mdash;According to R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja the combination
(sampatti) of the senses with the manas, &amp;c. is a mere
conjunction (sa<i>m</i>yoga), not a merging (laya).</p>
<p>Adhik. IV (7).&mdash;The vidv&acirc;n (i.e. according to
<i>S</i>a@nkara, he who possesses the lower knowledge) and the
avidv&acirc;n, i.e. he who does not possess any knowledge of
Brahman, pass through the same stages (i.e. those described
hitherto) up to the entrance of the soul, together with the subtle
elements, and so on into the n&acirc;<i>d</i>&icirc;s.&mdash;The
vidv&acirc;n also remains connected with the subtle elements
because he has not yet completely destroyed avidy&acirc;, so that
the immortality which Scripture ascribes to him
(am<i>ri</i>tatva<i>m</i> hi vidv&acirc;n abhya<i>s</i>nute) is
only a relative one.&mdash;R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja quotes the
following text regarding the immortality of the vidv&acirc;n:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'Yad&acirc; sarve pramu<i>k</i>yante k&acirc;m&acirc; yessya
h<i>ri</i>di sthit&acirc;<i>h</i> atha martyosm<i>ri</i>to bhavaty
atra brahma sama<i>s</i>nute,'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and explains that the immortality which is here ascribed to the
vidv&acirc;n as soon as he abandons all desires can only mean the
destruction&mdash;mentioned in the preceding p&acirc;da&mdash;of
all the effects of good and evil works, while the 'reaching of
Brahman' can only refer to the intuition of Brahman vouchsafed to
the meditating devotee.</p>
<p>Adhik. V (8-11) raises; according to <i>S</i>a@nkara, the
question whether the subtle elements of which Scripture says that
they are combined with the highest deity (teja<i>h</i>
parasy&acirc;<i>m</i> devat&acirc;y&acirc;m) are completely merged
in the latter or not. The answer is that a complete absorption of
the elements takes place only when final emancipation is reached;
that, on the other hand, as long as the sa<i>m</i>s&acirc;ra state
lasts, the elements, although somehow combined with <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="pageintro-80" id="pageintro-80"></a>{Intro
80}</span> Brahman, remain distinct so as to be able to form new
bodies for the soul.</p>
<p>According to R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja the S&ucirc;tras 8-11 do not
constitute a new adhikara<i>n</i>a, but continue the discussion of
the point mooted in 7. The immortality there spoken of does not
imply the separation of the soul from the body, 'because Scripture
declares sa<i>m</i>s&acirc;ra, i.e. embodiedness up to the reaching
of Brahman' (tasya t&acirc;vad eva <i>k</i>ira<i>m</i> y&acirc;van
na vimokshye atha sampatsye) (8).&mdash;That the soul after having
departed from the gross body is not disconnected from the subtle
elements, is also proved hereby, that the subtle body accompanies
it, as is observed from authority<a id="footnotetag20" name=
"footnotetag20"></a><a href="#footnote20"><sup>20</sup></a>
(9).&mdash;Hence the immortality referred to in the scriptural
passage quoted is not effected by means of the total destruction of
the body (10).</p>
<p>Adhik. VI (12-14) is of special importance.&mdash;According to
<i>S</i>a@nkara the S&ucirc;tras now turn from the discussion of
the departure of him who possesses the lower knowledge only to the
consideration of what becomes of him who has reached the higher
knowledge. So far it has been taught that in the case of relative
immortality (ensuing on the apara vidy&acirc;) the subtle elements,
together with the senses and so on, depart from the body of the
dying devotee; this implies at the same time that they do not
depart from the body of the dying sage who knows himself to be one
with Brahman.&mdash;Against this latter implied doctrine
S&ucirc;tra 12 is supposed to formulate an objection. 'If it be
said that the departure of the pr&acirc;<i>n</i>as from the body of
the dying sage is denied (viz. in B<i>ri</i>. Up. IV, 4, 5, na
tasya pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a utkr&acirc;manti, of him the
pr&acirc;<i>n</i>as do not pass out); we reply that in that passage
the genitive "tasya" has the sense of the ablative "tasm&acirc;t,"
so that the sense of the passage is, "from him, i.e. from the
j&icirc;va of the dying sage, the pr&acirc;<i>n</i>as do not
depart, but remain with it."'&mdash;This objection <i>S</i>a@nkara
supposes to be disposed of in S&ucirc;tra 13. 'By some there is
given a clear denial of the departure of the pr&acirc;<i>n</i>as in
the case of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-81" id=
"pageintro-81"></a>{Intro 81}</span> dying sage,' viz. in the
passage B<i>ri</i>. Up. III, 2, 11, where
Y&acirc;j<i>&ntilde;</i>avalkya instructs &Acirc;rtabh&acirc;ga
that, when this man dies, the pr&acirc;<i>n</i>as do not depart
from it (asm&acirc;t; the context showing that asm&acirc;t means
'from it,' viz. from the body, and not 'from him,' viz. the
j&icirc;va).&mdash;The same view is, moreover, confirmed by
Sm<i>ri</i>ti passages.</p>
<p>According to R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja the three S&ucirc;tras forming
<i>S</i>a@nkara's sixth adhikara<i>n</i>a do not constitute a new
adhikara<i>n</i>a at all, and, moreover, have to be combined into
two S&ucirc;tras. The topic continuing to be discussed is the
utkr&acirc;nti of the vidv&acirc;n. If, S&ucirc;tra 12 says, the
utkr&acirc;nti of the pr&acirc;<i>n</i>as is not admitted, on the
ground of the denial supposed to be contained in B<i>ri</i>. Up.
IV, 4, 5; the reply is that the sense of the tasya there is
'<i>s</i>&acirc;r&icirc;r&acirc;t' (so that the passage means,
'from him, i.e. the j&icirc;va, the pr&acirc;<i>n</i>as do not
depart'); for this is clearly shown by the reading of some, viz.
the M&acirc;dhyandinas, who, in their text of the passage, do not
read 'tasya' but 'tasm&acirc;t.'&mdash;With reference to the
instruction given by Y&acirc;j<i>&ntilde;</i>avalkya to
&Acirc;rtabh&acirc;ga, it is to be remarked that nothing there
shows the 'ayam purusha' to be the sage who knows
Brahman.&mdash;And, finally, there are Sm<i>ri</i>ti passages
declaring that the sage also when dying departs from the body.</p>
<p>Adhik. VII and VIII (15, 16) teach, according to
<i>S</i>a@nkara, that, on the death of him who possesses the higher
knowledge, his pr&acirc;<i>n</i>as, elements, &amp;c. are merged in
Brahman, so as to be no longer distinct from it in any way.</p>
<p>According to R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja the two S&ucirc;tras continue
the teaching about the pr&acirc;<i>n</i>as, bh&ucirc;tas, &amp;c.
of the vidv&acirc;n in general, and declare that they are finally
merged in Brahman, not merely in the way of conjunction
(sa<i>m</i>yoga), but completely.<a id="footnotetag21" name=
"footnotetag21"></a><a href="#footnote21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>Adhik. IX (17).&mdash;<i>S</i>a@nkara here returns to the owner
of the apar&acirc; vidy&acirc;, while R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja
continues the description of the utkr&acirc;nti of his
vidv&acirc;n.&mdash;The j&icirc;va of the dying man <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="pageintro-82" id="pageintro-82"></a>{Intro
82}</span> passes into the heart, and thence departs out of the
body by means of the n&aacute;<i>d</i>is; the vidv&acirc;n by means
of the n&acirc;<i>d</i>i called sushum<i>n</i>&acirc;, the
avidv&acirc;n by means of some other n&acirc;<i>d</i>&icirc;.</p>
<p>Adhik. X (18, 19).&mdash;The departing soul passes up to the sun
by means of a ray of light which exists at night as well as during
day.</p>
<p>Adhik. XI (20, 21).&mdash;Also that vidv&acirc;n who dies during
the dakshi<i>n</i>&acirc;yana reaches Brahman.</p>
<h4>P&Acirc;DA III.</h4>
<p>Adhik. I, II, III (1-3) reconcile the different accounts given
in the Upanishads as to the stations of the way which leads the
vidv&acirc;n up to Brahman.</p>
<p>Adhik. IV (4-6)&mdash;By the 'stations' we have, however, to
understand not only the subdivisions of the way but also the divine
beings which lead the soul on.</p>
<p>The remaining part of the p&acirc;da is by <i>S</i>a@nkara
divided into two adhikara<i>n</i>as. Of these the former one (7-14)
teaches that the Brahman to which the departed soul is led by the
guardians of the path of the gods is not the highest Brahman, but
the effected (k&acirc;rya) or qualified (<i>s</i>agu<i>n</i>a)
Brahman. This is the opinion propounded in S&ucirc;tras 7-11 by
B&acirc;dari, and, finally, accepted by <i>S</i>a@nkara in his
commentary on S&ucirc;tra 14. In S&ucirc;tras 12-14 Jaimini defends
the opposite view, according to which the soul of the vidv&acirc;n
goes to the highest Brahman, not to the k&acirc;ryam brahma. But
Jaimini's view, although set forth in the latter part of the
adhikara<i>n</i>a, is, according to <i>S</i>a@nkara, a mere
p&ucirc;rvapaksha, while B&acirc;dari's opinion represents the
siddh&acirc;nta.&mdash;The latter of the two adhikara<i>n</i>as (VI
of the whole p&acirc;da; 15, 16) records the opinion of
B&acirc;dar&acirc;ya<i>n</i>a on a collateral question, viz.
whether, or not, all those who worship the effected Brahman are led
to it. The decision is that those only are guided to Brahman who
have not worshipped it under a prat&icirc;ka form.</p>
<p>According to R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja, S&ucirc;tras 7-16 form one
adhikara<i>n</i>a only, in which the views of B&acirc;dari and of
Jaimini represent two p&ucirc;rvapakshas, while
B&acirc;dar&acirc;ya<i>n</i>a's opinion is adopted <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="pageintro-83" id="pageintro-83"></a>{Intro
83}</span> as the siddh&acirc;nta. The question is whether the
guardians of the path lead to Brahman only those who worship the
effected Brahman, i.e. Hira<i>n</i>yagarbha, or those who worship
the highest Brahman, or those who worship the individual soul as
free from Prak<i>ri</i>ti, and having Brahman for its Self (ye
pratyag&acirc;tm&acirc;na<i>m</i> prak<i>ri</i>tiviyukta<i>m</i>
brahm&acirc;tmakam up&acirc;sate).&mdash;The first view is
maintained by B&acirc;dari in S&ucirc;tra 7, 'The guardians lead to
Brahman those who worship the effected Brahman, because going is
possible towards the latter only;' for no movement can take place
towards the highest and as such omnipresent Brahman.&mdash;The
explanation of S&ucirc;tra 9 is similar to that of <i>S</i>a@nkara;
but more clearly replies to the objection (that, if
Hira<i>n</i>yagarbha were meant in the passage, 'purusho <i>s</i>a
m&acirc;nava<i>h</i> sa et&acirc;n brahma gamayati,' the text would
read 'sa et&acirc;n brahm&acirc;<i>n</i>am gamayati') that
Hira<i>n</i>yagarbha is called Brahman on account of his nearness
to Brahman, i.e. on account of his prathamajatva.&mdash;The
explanation of 10, 11 is essentially the same as in
<i>S</i>a@nkara; so also of l2-l4.&mdash;The siddh&acirc;nta view
is established in S&ucirc;tra 13, 'It is the opinion of
B&acirc;dar&acirc;ya<i>n</i>a that it, i.e. the ga<i>n</i>a of the
guardians, leads to Brahman those who do not take their stand on
what is prat&icirc;ka, i.e. those who worship the highest Brahman,
and those who meditate on the individual Self as dissociated from
prak<i>ri</i>ti, and having Brahman for its Self, but not those who
worship Brahman under prat&icirc;kas. For both views&mdash;that of
Jaimini as well as that of B&acirc;dari&mdash;are faulty.' The
k&acirc;rya view contradicts such passages as 'asm&acirc;<i>k</i>
char&icirc;r&acirc;t samutth&acirc;ya para<i>m</i> jyotir
upasampadya,' &amp;c.; the para view, such passages as that in the
pa<i>&ntilde;k</i>&acirc;gni-vidy&acirc;, which declares that ya
ittha<i>m</i> vidu<i>h</i>, i.e. those who know the
pa<i>&ntilde;k</i>&acirc;gni-vidy&acirc;, are also led up to
Brahman.</p>
<h4>P&Acirc;DA IV.</h4>
<p>Adhik. I (1-3) returns, according to <i>S</i>a@nkara, to the
owner of the par&acirc; vidy&acirc;, and teaches that, when on his
death his soul obtains final release, it does not acquire any new
characteristics, but merely manifests itself in its true
nature.&mdash;The explanation given by R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja is
essentially <span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-84" id=
"pageintro-84"></a>{Intro 84}</span> the same, but of course refers
to that vidv&acirc;n whose going to Brahman had been described in
the preceding p&acirc;da.</p>
<p>Adhik. II (4) determines that the relation in which the released
soul stands to Brahman is that of avibh&acirc;ga, non-separation.
This, on <i>S</i>a@nkara's view, means absolute non-separation,
identity.&mdash;According to R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja the question to
be considered is whether the released soul views itself as separate
(p<i>ri</i>thagbh&ucirc;ta) from Brahman, or as non-separate
because being a mode of Brahman. The former view is favoured by
those <i>S</i>ruti and Sm<i>ri</i>ti passages which speak of the
soul as being with, or equal to, Brahman; the latter by, such
passages as tat tvam asi and the like.<a id="footnotetag22" name=
"footnotetag22"></a><a href="#footnote22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>Adhik. III (5-7) discusses the characteristics of the released
soul (i.e. of the truly released soul, according to
<i>S</i>a@nkara). According to Jaimini the released soul, when
manifesting itself in its true nature, possesses all those
qualities which in Ch. Up. VIII, 7, 1 and other places are ascribed
to Brahman, such as apahatap&acirc;pmatva, satyasa<i>m</i>kalpatva,
&amp;c., ai<i>s</i>varya.&mdash;According to Au<i>d</i>ulomi the
only characteristic of the released soul is
<i>k</i>aitanya.&mdash;According to B&acirc;dar&acirc;yana the two
views can be combined (<i>S</i>a@nkara remarking that
satyasa<i>m</i>kalpatva, &amp;c. are ascribed to the released soul
vyavah&acirc;r&acirc;pekshay&acirc;).</p>
<p>Adhik. IV (8-9) returns, according to <i>S</i>a@nkara, to the
apar&acirc; vidy&acirc;, and discusses the question whether the
soul of <span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-85" id=
"pageintro-85"></a>{Intro 85}</span> the pious effects its desires
by its mere determination, or uses some other means. The former
alternative is accepted&mdash;According to R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja the
adhikara<i>n</i>a simply continues the consideration of the state
of the released, begun in the preceding adhikara<i>n</i>a. Of the
released soul it is said in Ch. Up. VIII, 12, 3 that after it has
manifested itself in its true nature it moves about playing and
rejoicing with women, carriages, and so on. The question then
arises whether it effects all this by its mere sa<i>m</i>kalpa (it
having been shown in the preceding adhikara<i>n</i>a that the
released soul is, like the Lord, satyasa<i>m</i>kalpa), or not. The
answer is in favour of the former alternative, on account of the
explicit declaration made in Ch. Up. VIII, 2, 'By his mere will the
fathers come to receive him.'</p>
<p>Adhik. V (10-14) decides that the released are embodied or
disembodied according to their wish and will.</p>
<p>Adhik. VI (11, 12) explains how the soul of the released can
animate several bodies at the same time.&mdash;S&ucirc;tra 12
gives, according to <i>S</i>a@nkara, the additional explanation
that those passages which declare the absence of all specific
cognition on the part of the released soul do not refer to the
partly released soul of the devotee, but either to the soul in the
state of deep sleep (sv&acirc;pyaya = sushupti), or to the fully
released soul of the sage (sampatti =
kaivalya).&mdash;R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja explains that the passages
speaking of absence of consciousness refer either to the state of
deep sleep, or to the time of dying (sampatti = mata<i>n</i>am
according to 'v&acirc;n manasi sampadyate,' &amp;c.).</p>
<p>Adhik. VII (17-21).&mdash;The released j&icirc;vas participate
in all the perfections and powers of the Lord, with the exception
of the power of creating and sustaining the world. They do not
return to new forms of embodied existence.</p>
<p>After having, in this way, rendered ourselves acquainted with
the contents of the Brahma-s&ucirc;tras according to the views of
<i>S</i>a@nkara as well as R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja, we have now to
consider the question which of the two modes of interpretation
represents&mdash;or at any rate more closely approximates to the
true meaning of the S&ucirc;tras. That <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="pageintro-86" id="pageintro-86"></a>{Intro
86}</span> few of the S&ucirc;tras are intelligible if taken by
themselves, we have already remarked above; but this does not
exclude the possibility of our deciding with a fair degree of
certainty which of the two interpretations proposed agrees better
with the text, at least in a certain number of cases.</p>
<p>We have to note in the first place that, in spite of very
numerous discrepancies,&mdash;of which only the more important ones
have been singled out in the conspectus of contents,&mdash;the two
commentators are at one as to the general drift of the S&ucirc;tras
and the arrangement of topics. As a rule, the adhikara<i>n</i>as
discuss one or several Vedic passages bearing upon a certain point
of the system, and in the vast majority of cases the two
commentators agree as to which are the special texts referred to.
And, moreover, in a very large number of cases the agreement
extends to the interpretation to be put on those passages and on
the S&ucirc;tras. This far-reaching agreement certainly tends to
inspire us with a certain confidence as to the existence of an old
tradition concerning the meaning of the S&ucirc;tras on which the
bulk of the interpretations of <i>S</i>a@nkara as well as of
R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja are based.</p>
<p>But at the same time we have seen that, in a not inconsiderable
number of cases, the interpretations of <i>S</i>a@nkara and
R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja diverge more or less widely, and that the
S&ucirc;tras affected thereby are, most of them, especially
important because bearing on fundamental points of the
Ved&acirc;nta system. The question then remains which of the two
interpretations is entitled to preference.</p>
<p>Regarding a small number of S&ucirc;tras I have already (in the
conspectus of contents) given it as my opinion that
R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja's explanation appears to be more worthy of
consideration. We meet, in the first place, with a number of cases
in which the two commentators agree as to the literal meaning of a
S&ucirc;tra, but where <i>S</i>a@nkara sees himself reduced to the
necessity of supplementing his interpretation by certain additions
and reservations of his own for which the text gives no occasion,
while R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja is able to take the S&ucirc;tra as it
stands. To exemplify this remark, I again direct attention to all
those S&ucirc;tras which in <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"pageintro-87" id="pageintro-87"></a>{Intro 87}</span> clear terms
represent the individual soul as something different from the
highest soul, and concerning which <i>S</i>a@nkara is each time
obliged to have recourse to the plea of the S&ucirc;tra referring,
not to what is true in the strict sense of the word, but only to
what is conventionally looked upon as true. It is, I admit, not
altogether impossible that <i>S</i>a@nkara's interpretation should
represent the real meaning of the S&ucirc;tras; that the latter,
indeed, to use the terms employed by Dr. Deussen, should for the
nonce set forth an exoteric doctrine adapted to the common notions
of mankind, which, however, can be rightly understood by him only
to whose mind the esoteric doctrine is all the while present. This
is not impossible, I say; but it is a point which requires
convincing proofs before it can be allowed.&mdash;We have had, in
the second place, to note a certain number of adhikara<i>n</i>as
and S&ucirc;tras concerning whose interpretation <i>S</i>a@nkara
and R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja disagree altogether; and we have seen that
not unfrequently the explanations given by the latter commentator
appear to be preferable because falling in more easily with the
words of the text. The most striking instance of this is afforded
by the 13th adhikara<i>n</i>a of II, 3, which treats of the size of
the j&icirc;va, and where R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja's explanation seems
to be decidedly superior to <i>S</i>a@nkara's, both if we look to
the arrangement of the whole adhikara<i>n</i>a and to the wording
of the single S&ucirc;tras. The adhikara<i>n</i>a is, moreover, a
specially important one, because the nature of the view held as to
the size of the individual soul goes far to settle the question
what kind of Ved&acirc;nta is embodied in
B&acirc;dar&acirc;ya<i>n</i>a's work.</p>
<p>But it will be requisite not only to dwell on the
interpretations of a few detached S&ucirc;tras, but to make the
attempt at least of forming some opinion as to the relation of the
Ved&acirc;nta-s&ucirc;tras as a whole to the chief distinguishing
doctrines of <i>S</i>a@nkara as well as R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja. Such
an attempt may possibly lead to very slender positive results; but
in the present state of the enquiry even a merely negative result,
viz. the conclusion that the S&ucirc;tras do not teach particular
doctrines found in them by certain commentators, will not be
without its value.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-88" id=
"pageintro-88"></a>{Intro 88}</span>
<p>The first question we wish to consider in some detail is whether
the S&ucirc;tras in any way favour <i>S</i>a@nkara's doctrine that
we have to distinguish a twofold knowledge of Brahman, a higher
knowledge which leads to the immediate absorption, on death, of the
individual soul in Brahman, and a lower knowledge which raises its
owner merely to an exalted form of individual existence. The
adhy&acirc;ya first to be considered in this connexion is the
fourth one. According to <i>S</i>a@nkara the three latter
p&acirc;das of that adhy&acirc;ya are chiefly engaged in describing
the fate of him who dies in the possession of the lower knowledge,
while two sections (IV, 2, 12-14; IV, 4, 1-7) tell us what happens
to him who, before his death, had risen to the knowledge of the
highest Brahman. According to R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja, on the other
hand, the three p&acirc;das, referring throughout to one subject
only, give an uninterrupted account of the successive steps by
which the soul of him who knows the Lord through the Upanishads
passes, at the time of death, out of the gross body which it had
tenanted, ascends to the world of Brahman, and lives there for ever
without returning into the sa<i>m</i>s&acirc;ra.</p>
<p>On an a priori view of the matter it certainly appears somewhat
strange that the concluding section of the S&ucirc;tras should be
almost entirely taken up with describing the fate of him who has
after all acquired an altogether inferior knowledge only, and has
remained shut out from the true sanctuary of Ved&acirc;ntic
knowledge, while the fate of the fully initiated is disposed of in
a few occasional S&ucirc;tras. It is, I think, not too much to say
that no unbiassed student of the S&ucirc;tras would&mdash;before
having allowed himself to be influenced by <i>S</i>a@nkara's
interpretations&mdash;imagine for a moment that the solemn words,
'From thence is no return, from thence is no return,' with which
the S&ucirc;tras conclude, are meant to describe, not the lasting
condition of him who has reached final release, the highest aim of
man, but merely a stage on the way of that soul which is engaged in
the slow progress of gradual release, a stage which is indeed
greatly superior to any earthly form of existence, but yet itself
belongs to the essentially fictitious sa<i>m</i>s&acirc;ra,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-89" id=
"pageintro-89"></a>{Intro 89}</span> and as such remains infinitely
below the bliss of true mukti. And this &agrave; priori
impression&mdash;which, although no doubt significant, could hardly
be appealed to as decisive&mdash;is confirmed by a detailed
consideration of the two sets of S&ucirc;tras which <i>S</i>a@nkara
connects with the knowledge of the higher Brahman. How these
S&ucirc;tras are interpreted by <i>S</i>a@nkara and
R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja has been stated above in the conspectus of
contents; the points which render the interpretation given by
R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja more probable are as follows. With regard to
IV, 2, 12-14, we have to note, in the first place, the
circumstance&mdash;relevant although not decisive in
itself&mdash;that S&ucirc;tra 12 does not contain any indication of
a new topic being introduced. In the second place, it can hardly be
doubted that the text of S&ucirc;tra 13, 'spash<i>t</i>o hy
ekesh&acirc;m,' is more appropriately understood, with
R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja, as furnishing a reason for the opinion
advanced in the preceding S&ucirc;tra, than&mdash;with
<i>S</i>a@nkara&mdash;as embodying the refutation of a previous
statement (in which latter case we should expect not 'hi' but
'tu'). And, in the third place, the 'eke,' i.e. 'some,' referred to
in S&ucirc;tra 13 would, on <i>S</i>a@nkara's interpretation,
denote the very same persons to whom the preceding S&ucirc;tra had
referred, viz. the followers of the
K&acirc;<i>n</i>va-<i>s</i>&acirc;kh&acirc; (the two Vedic passages
referred to in 12 and 13 being B<i>ri</i>. Up. IV, 4, 5, and III,
2, 11, according to the K&acirc;<i>n</i>va recension); while it is
the standing practice of the S&ucirc;tras to introduce, by means of
the designation 'eke,' members of Vedic <i>s</i>&acirc;kh&acirc;s,
teachers, &amp;c. other than those alluded to in the preceding
S&ucirc;tras. With this practice R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja's
interpretation, on the other hand, fully agrees; for, according to
him, the 'eke' are the M&acirc;dhyandinas, whose reading in
B<i>ri</i>. Up. IV, 4, 5, viz. 'tasm&acirc;t,' clearly indicates
that the 'tasya' in the corresponding passage of the
K&acirc;<i>n</i>vas denotes the <i>s</i>&acirc;rira, i.e. the
j&icirc;va. I think it is not saying too much that
<i>S</i>a@nkara's explanation, according to which the 'eke' would
denote the very same K&acirc;<i>n</i>vas to whom the preceding
S&ucirc;tra had referred&mdash;so that the K&acirc;<i>n</i>vas
would be distinguished from themselves as it were&mdash;is
altogether impossible.</p>
<p>The result of this closer consideration of the first set of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-90" id=
"pageintro-90"></a>{Intro 90}</span> S&ucirc;tras, alleged by
<i>S</i>a@nkara to concern the owner of the higher knowledge of
Brahman, entitles us to view with some distrust <i>S</i>a@nkara's
assertion that another set also&mdash;IV, 4, 1-7&mdash;has to be
detached from the general topic of the fourth adhy&acirc;ya, and to
be understood as depicting the condition of those who have obtained
final absolute release. And the S&ucirc;tras themselves do not tend
to weaken this preliminary want of confidence. In the first place
their wording also gives no indication whatever of their having to
be separated from what precedes as well as what follows. And, in
the second place, the last S&ucirc;tra of the set (7) obliges
<i>S</i>a@nkara to ascribe to his truly released souls qualities
which clearly cannot belong to them; so that he finally is obliged
to make the extraordinary statement that those qualities belong to
them 'vyavah&acirc;r&acirc;pekshay&acirc;,' while yet the purport
of the whole adhikara<i>n</i>a is said to be the description of the
truly released soul for which no vyavah&acirc;ra exists! Very truly
<i>S</i>a@nkara's commentator here remarks, 'atra ke<i>k</i>in
muhyanti akha<i>n</i>da<i>k</i>inm&acirc;traj&acirc;n&acirc;n
muktasy&acirc;j&ntilde;&acirc;n&acirc;bh&acirc;v&acirc;t kuta
&acirc;j<i>&ntilde;</i>&acirc;nika-dharmayoga<i>h</i>,' and the way
in which thereupon he himself attempts to get over the difficulty
certainly does not improve matters.</p>
<p>In connexion with the two passages discussed, we meet in the
fourth adhy&acirc;ya with another passage, which indeed has no
direct bearing on the distinction of apar&acirc; and par&acirc;
vidy&acirc;, but may yet be shortly referred to in this place as
another and altogether undoubted instance of <i>S</i>a@nkara's
interpretations not always agreeing with the text of the
S&ucirc;tras. The S&ucirc;tras 7-16 of the third p&acirc;da state
the opinions of three different teachers on the question to which
Brahman the soul of the vidv&acirc;n repairs on death,
or&mdash;according to R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja&mdash;the worshippers of
which Brahman repair to (the highest) Brahman. R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja
treats the views of B&acirc;dari and Jaimini as two
p&ucirc;rvapakshas, and the opinion of
B&acirc;dar&acirc;ya<i>n</i>a&mdash;which is stated last&mdash;as
the siddh&acirc;nta. <i>S</i>a@nkara, on the other hand, detaching
the S&ucirc;tras in which B&acirc;dar&acirc;ya<i>n</i>a's view is
set forth from the preceding part of the adhikara<i>n</i>a (a
proceeding which, although not <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"pageintro-91" id="pageintro-91"></a>{Intro 91}</span> plausible,
yet cannot be said to be altogether illegitimate), maintains that
B&acirc;dari's view, which is expounded first, represents the
siddh&acirc;nta, while Jaimini's view, set forth subsequently, is
to be considered a mere p&ucirc;rvapaksha. This, of course, is
altogether inadmissible, it being the invariable practice of the
Ved&acirc;nta-s&ucirc;tras as well as the P&ucirc;rva
M&icirc;m&acirc;<i>m</i>s&acirc;-s&ucirc;tras to conclude the
discussion of contested points with the statement of that view
which is to be accepted as the authoritative one. This is so patent
that <i>S</i>a@nkara feels himself called upon to defend his
deviation from the general rule (Commentary on IV, 4, 13), without,
however, bringing forward any arguments but such as are valid only
if <i>S</i>a@nkara's system itself is already accepted.</p>
<p>The previous considerations leave us, I am inclined to think, no
choice but to side with R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja as to the general
subject-matter of the fourth adhy&acirc;ya of the S&ucirc;tras. We
need not accept him as our guide in all particular interpretations,
but we must acknowledge with him that the S&ucirc;tras of the
fourth adhy&acirc;ya describe the ultimate fate of one and the same
vidv&acirc;n, and do not afford any basis for the distinction of a
higher and lower knowledge of Brahman in <i>S</i>a@nkara's
sense.</p>
<p>If we have not to discriminate between a lower and a higher
knowledge of Brahman, it follows that the distinction of a lower
and a higher Brahman is likewise not valid. But this is not a point
to be decided at once on the negative evidence of the fourth
adhy&acirc;ya, but regarding which the entire body of the
Ved&acirc;nta-s&ucirc;tras has to be consulted. And intimately
connected with this investigation&mdash;in fact, one with it from a
certain point of view&mdash;is the question whether the
S&ucirc;tras afford any evidence of their author having held the
doctrine of M&acirc;y&acirc;, the principle of illusion, by the
association with which the highest Brahman, in itself transcending
all qualities, appears as the lower Brahman or &Icirc;<i>s</i>vara.
That R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja denies the distinction of the two
Brahmans and the doctrine of M&acirc;y&acirc; we have seen above;
we shall, however, in the subsequent investigation, pay less
attention to his views and interpretations <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="pageintro-92" id="pageintro-92"></a>{Intro
92}</span> than to the indications furnished by the S&ucirc;tras
themselves.</p>
<p>Placing myself at the point of view of a <i>S</i>a@nkara, I am
startled at the outset by the second S&ucirc;tra of the first
adhy&acirc;ya, which undertakes to give a definition of Brahman.
'Brahman is that whence the origination and so on (i.e. the
sustentation and reabsorption) of this world proceed.' What, we
must ask, is this S&ucirc;tra meant to define?&mdash;That Brahman,
we are inclined to answer, whose cognition the first S&ucirc;tra
declares to constitute the task of the entire Ved&acirc;nta; that
Brahman whose cognition is the only road to final release; that
Brahman in fact which <i>S</i>a@nkara calls the highest.&mdash;But,
here we must object to ourselves, the highest Brahman is not
properly defined as that from which the world originates. In later
Ved&acirc;ntic writings, whose authors were clearly conscious of
the distinction of the higher absolute Brahman and the lower
Brahman related to M&acirc;y&acirc; or the world, we meet with
definitions of Brahman of an altogether different type. I need only
remind the reader of the current definition of Brahman as
sa<i>k</i>-<i>k</i>id-&acirc;nanda, or, to mention one individual
instance, refer to the introductory <i>s</i>lokas of the
Pa<i>&ntilde;k</i>ada<i>s</i>&icirc; dilating on the sa<i>m</i>vid
svayam-prabh&acirc;, the self-luminous principle of thought which
in all time, past or future, neither starts into being nor perishes
(P.D. I, 7). 'That from which the world proceeds' can by a
<i>S</i>a@nkara be accepted only as a definition of
&Icirc;<i>s</i>vara, of Brahman which by its association with
M&acirc;y&acirc; is enabled to project the false appearance of this
world, and it certainly is as improbable that the S&ucirc;tras
should open with a definition of that inferior principle, from
whose cognition there can accrue no permanent benefit, as,
according to a remark made above, it is unlikely that they should
conclude with a description of the state of those who know the
lower Brahman only, and thus are debarred from obtaining true
release. As soon, on the other hand, as we discard the idea of a
twofold Brahman and conceive Brahman as one only, as the
all-enfolding being which sometimes emits the world from its own
substance and sometimes again retracts it into itself, ever
remaining one in all its <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"pageintro-93" id="pageintro-93"></a>{Intro 93}</span> various
manifestations&mdash;a conception which need not by any means be
modelled in all its details on the views of the
R&acirc;m&acirc;nujas&mdash;the definition of Brahman given in the
second S&ucirc;tra becomes altogether unobjectionable.</p>
<p>We next enquire whether the impression left on the mind by the
manner in which B&acirc;dar&acirc;ya<i>n</i>a defines Brahman, viz.
that he does not distinguish between an absolute Brahman and a
Brahman associated with M&acirc;y&acirc;, is confirmed or weakened
by any other parts of his work. The S&ucirc;tras being throughout
far from direct in their enunciations, we shall have to look less
to particular terms and turns of expression than to general lines
of reasoning. What in this connexion seems specially worthy of
being taken into account, is the style of argumentation employed by
the S&ucirc;trak&acirc;ra against the S&acirc;@nkhya doctrine,
which maintains that the world has originated, not from an
intelligent being, but from the non-intelligent pradh&acirc;na. The
most important S&ucirc;tras relative to this point are to be met
with in the first p&acirc;da of the second adhy&acirc;ya. Those
S&ucirc;tras are indeed almost unintelligible if taken by
themselves, but the unanimity of the commentators as to their
meaning enables us to use them as steps in our investigation. The
sixth S&ucirc;tra of the p&acirc;da mentioned replies to the
S&acirc;@nkhya objection that the non-intelligent world cannot
spring from an intelligent principle, by the remark that 'it is
thus seen,' i.e. it is a matter of common observation that
non-intelligent things are produced from beings endowed with
intelligence; hair and nails, for instance, springing from animals,
and certain insects from dung.&mdash;Now, an argumentation of this
kind is altogether out of place from the point of view of the true
<i>S</i>&acirc;@nkara. According to the latter the non-intelligent
world does not spring from Brahman in so far as the latter is
intelligence, but in so far as it is associated with
M&acirc;y&acirc;. M&acirc;y&acirc; is the up&acirc;d&acirc;na of
the material world, and M&acirc;y&acirc; itself is of a
non-intelligent nature, owing to which it is by so many
Ved&acirc;ntic writers identified with the prak<i>ri</i>ti of the
S&acirc;@nkhyas. Similarly the illustrative instances, adduced
under S&ucirc;tra 9 for the purpose of showing that effects when
being reabsorbed into their causal substances <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="pageintro-94" id="pageintro-94"></a>{Intro
94}</span> do not impart to the latter their own qualities, and
that hence the material world also, when being refunded into
Brahman, does not impart to it its own imperfections, are
singularly inappropriate if viewed in connexion with the doctrine
of M&acirc;y&acirc;, according to which the material world is no
more in Brahman at the time of a pralaya than during the period of
its subsistence. According to <i>S</i>&acirc;@nkara the world is
not merged in Brahman, but the special forms into which the
up&acirc;d&acirc;na of the world, i.e. M&acirc;y&acirc;, had
modified itself are merged in non-distinct M&acirc;y&acirc;, whose
relation to Brahman is not changed thereby.&mdash;The illustration,
again, given in S&ucirc;tra 24 of the mode in which Brahman, by
means of its inherent power, transforms itself into the world
without employing any extraneous instruments of action,
'ksh&icirc;ravad dhi,' 'as milk (of its own accord turns into
curds),' would be strangely chosen indeed if meant to bring nearer
to our understanding the mode in which Brahman projects the
illusive appearance of the world; and also the analogous instance
given in the S&ucirc;tra next following, 'as Gods and the like
(create palaces, chariots, &amp;c. by the mere power of their
will)'&mdash;which refers to the real creation of real
things&mdash;would hardly be in its place if meant to illustrate a
theory which considers unreality to be the true character of the
world. The mere cumulation of the two essentially heterogeneous
illustrative instances (ksh&icirc;ravad dhi; dev&acirc;divat),
moreover, seems to show that the writer who had recourse to them
held no very definite theory as to the particular mode in which the
world springs from Brahman, but was merely concerned to render
plausible in some way or other that an intelligent being can give
rise to what is non-intelligent without having recourse to any
extraneous means.<a id="footnotetag23" name=
"footnotetag23"></a><a href="#footnote23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>That the M&acirc;y&acirc; doctrine was not present to the mind
of the S&ucirc;trak&acirc;ra, further appears from the latter part
of the fourth p&acirc;da of the first adhy&acirc;ya, where it is
shown that Brahman is not only the operative but also the material
cause of the world. If anywhere, there would have been <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="pageintro-95" id="pageintro-95"></a>{Intro
95}</span> the place to indicate, had such been the author's view,
that Brahman is the material cause of the world through
M&acirc;y&acirc; only, and that the world is unreal; but the
S&ucirc;tras do not contain a single word to that effect.
S&ucirc;tra 26, on the other hand, exhibits the significant term
'pari<i>n</i>&acirc;m&acirc;t;' Brahman produces the world by means
of a modification of itself. It is well known that later on, when
the terminology of the Ved&acirc;nta became definitely settled, the
term 'pari<i>n</i>&acirc;vada' was used to denote that very theory
to which the followers of <i>S</i>a@nkara are most violently
opposed, viz. the doctrine according to which the world is not a
mere vivarta, i.e. an illusory manifestation of Brahman, but the
effect of Brahman undergoing a real change, may that change be
conceived to take place in the way taught by R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja
or in some other manner.&mdash;With regard to the last-quoted
S&ucirc;tra, as well as to those touched upon above, the
commentators indeed maintain that whatever terms and modes of
expression are apparently opposed to the vivartav&acirc;da are in
reality reconcilable with it; to S&ucirc;tra 26, for instance,
Govind&acirc;nanda remarks that the term 'pari<i>n</i>&acirc;ma'
only denotes an effect in general (k&acirc;ryam&acirc;tra), without
implying that the effect is real. But in cases of this nature we
are fully entitled to use our own judgment, even if we were not
compelled to do so by the fact that other commentators, such as
R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja, are satisfied to take 'pari<i>n</i>&acirc;ma'
and similar terms in their generally received sense.</p>
<p>A further section treating of the nature of Brahman is met with
in III, 2, 11 ff. It is, according to <i>S</i>a@nkara's view, of
special importance, as it is alleged to set forth that Brahman is
in itself destitute of all qualities, and is affected with
qualities only through its limiting adjuncts (up&acirc;dhis), the
offspring of M&acirc;y&acirc;. I have above (in the conspectus of
contents) given a somewhat detailed abstract of the whole section
as interpreted by <i>S</i>a@nkara on the one hand, and
R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja on the other hand, from which it appears that
the latter's opinion as to the purport of the group of S&ucirc;tras
widely diverges from that of <i>S</i>a@nkara. The wording of the
S&ucirc;tras is so eminently concise and vague that I find it
impossible to decide which of the two commentators&mdash;if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-96" id=
"pageintro-96"></a>{Intro 96}</span> indeed either&mdash;is to be
accepted as a trustworthy guide; regarding the sense of some
S&ucirc;tras <i>S</i>a@nkara's explanation seems to deserve
preference, in the case of others R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja seems to
keep closer to the text. I decidedly prefer, for instance,
R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja's interpretation of S&ucirc;tra 22, as far as
the sense of the entire S&ucirc;tra is concerned, and more
especially with regard to the term
'prak<i>ri</i>tait&acirc;vattvam,' whose proper force is brought
out by R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja's explanation only. So much is certain
that none of the S&ucirc;tras decidedly favours the interpretation
proposed by <i>S</i>a@nkara. Whichever commentator we follow, we
greatly miss coherence and strictness of reasoning, and it is thus
by no means improbable that the section is one of
those&mdash;perhaps not few in number&mdash;in which both
interpreters had less regard to the literal sense of the words and
to tradition than to their desire of forcing
B&acirc;dar&acirc;ya<i>n</i>a's S&ucirc;tras to bear testimony to
the truth of their own philosophic theories.</p>
<p>With special reference to the M&acirc;y&acirc; doctrine one
important S&ucirc;tra has yet to be considered, the only one in
which the term 'm&acirc;y&acirc;' itself occurs, viz. III, 2, 3.
According to <i>S</i>a@nkara the S&ucirc;tra signifies that the
environments of the dreaming soul are not real but mere
M&acirc;y&acirc;, i.e. unsubstantial illusion, because they do not
fully manifest the character of real objects. R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja
(as we have seen in the conspectus) gives a different explanation
of the term 'm&acirc;y&acirc;,' but in judging of <i>S</i>a@nkara's
views we may for the time accept <i>S</i>a@nkara's own
interpretation. Now, from the latter it clearly follows that if the
objects seen in dreams are to be called M&acirc;y&acirc;, i.e.
illusion, because not evincing the characteristics of reality, the
objective world surrounding the waking soul must not be called
M&acirc;y&acirc;. But that the world perceived by waking men is
M&acirc;y&acirc;, even in a higher sense than the world presented
to the dreaming consciousness, is an undoubted tenet of the
<i>S</i>&acirc;@nkara Ved&acirc;nta; and the S&ucirc;tra therefore
proves either that B&acirc;dar&acirc;ya<i>n</i>a did not hold the
doctrine of the illusory character of the world, or else that, if
after all he did hold that doctrine, he used the term
'm&acirc;y&acirc;' in a sense altogether different from that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-97" id=
"pageintro-97"></a>{Intro 97}</span> in which <i>S</i>a@nkara
employs it.&mdash;If, on the other hand, we, with
R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja, understand the word 'm&acirc;y&acirc;' to
denote a wonderful thing, the S&ucirc;tra of course has no bearing
whatever on the doctrine of M&acirc;y&acirc; in its later technical
sense.</p>
<p>We now turn to the question as to the relation of the individual
soul to Brahman. Do the S&ucirc;tras indicate anywhere that their
author held <i>S</i>a@nkara's doctrine, according to which the
j&icirc;va is in reality identical with Brahman, and separated from
it, as it were, only by a false surmise due to avidy&acirc;, or do
they rather favour the view that the souls, although they have
sprung from Brahman, and constitute elements of its nature, yet
enjoy a kind of individual existence apart from it? This question
is in fact only another aspect of the M&acirc;y&acirc; question,
but yet requires a short separate treatment.</p>
<p>In the conspectus I have given it as my opinion that the
S&ucirc;tras in which the size of the individual soul is discussed
can hardly be understood in <i>S</i>a@nkara's sense, and rather
seem to favour the opinion, held among others by
R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja, that the soul is of minute size. We have
further seen that S&ucirc;tra 18 of the third p&acirc;da of the
second adhy&acirc;ya, which describes the soul as
'j<i>&ntilde;</i>a,' is more appropriately understood in the sense
assigned to it by R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja; and, again, that the
S&ucirc;tras which treat of the soul being an agent, can be
reconciled with <i>S</i>a@nkara's views only if supplemented in a
way which their text does not appear to authorise.&mdash;We next
have the important S&ucirc;tra II, 3, 43 in which the soul is
distinctly said to be a part (a<i>ms</i>a) of Brahman, and which,
as we have already noticed, can be made to fall in with
<i>S</i>a@nkara's views only if a<i>ms</i>a is explained,
altogether arbitrarily, by 'a<i>ms</i>a iva,' while
R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja is able to take the S&ucirc;tra as it
stands.&mdash;We also have already referred to S&ucirc;tra 50,
'&acirc;bh&acirc;sa eva <i>k</i>a,' which <i>S</i>a@nkara
interprets as setting forth the so-called pratibimbav&acirc;da
according to which the individual Self is merely a reflection of
the highest Self. But almost every S&ucirc;tra&mdash;and
S&ucirc;tra 50 forms no exception&mdash;being so obscurely
expressed, that viewed by itself it admits of various, often
totally opposed, interpretations, the only safe method is to keep
in view, in the case of each ambiguous <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="pageintro-98" id="pageintro-98"></a>{Intro
98}</span> aphorism, the general drift and spirit of the whole
work, and that, as we have seen hitherto, is by no means favourable
to the pratibimba doctrine. How indeed could S&ucirc;tra 50, if
setting forth that latter doctrine, be reconciled with S&ucirc;tra
43, which says distinctly that the soul is a part of Brahman? For
that 43 contains, as <i>S</i>a@nkara and his commentators aver, a
statement of the ava<i>kkh</i>edav&acirc;da, can itself be accepted
only if we interpret a<i>ms</i>a by a<i>ms</i>a iva, and to do so
there is really no valid reason whatever. I confess that
R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja's interpretation of the S&ucirc;tra (which
however is accepted by several other commentators also) does not
appear to me particularly convincing; and the S&ucirc;tras
unfortunately offer us no other passages on the ground of which we
might settle the meaning to be ascribed to the term
&acirc;bh&acirc;sa, which may mean 'reflection,' but may mean
hetv&acirc;bh&acirc;sa, i.e. fallacious argument, as well. But as
things stand, this one S&ucirc;tra cannot, at any rate, be appealed
to as proving that the pratibimbav&acirc;da which, in its turn,
presupposes the m&acirc;y&acirc;v&acirc;da, is the teaching of the
S&ucirc;tras.</p>
<p>To the conclusion that the S&ucirc;trak&acirc;ra did not hold
the doctrine of the absolute identity of the highest and the
individual soul in the sense of <i>S</i>a@nkara, we are further led
by some other indications to be met with here and there in the
S&ucirc;tras. In the conspectus of contents we have had occasion to
direct attention to the important S&ucirc;tra II, 1, 22, which
distinctly enunciates that the Lord is adhika, i.e. additional to,
or different from, the individual soul, since Scripture declares
the two to be different. Analogously I, 2, 20 lays stress on the
fact that the <i>s</i>&acirc;r&icirc;ra is not the
antary&acirc;min, because the M&acirc;dhyandinas, as well as the
K&acirc;<i>n</i>vas, speak of him in their texts as different
(bhedena enam adh&icirc;yate), and in 22 the
<i>s</i>&acirc;r&icirc;ra and the pradh&acirc;na are referred to as
the two 'others' (itarau) of whom the text predicates distinctive
attributes separating them from the highest Lord. The word 'itara'
(the other one) appears in several other passages (I, 1, 16; I, 3,
16; II, 1, 21) as a kind of technical term denoting the individual
soul in contradistinction from the Lord. The <i>S</i>&acirc;@nkaras
indeed maintain that all those passages refer to an unreal
distinction <span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-99" id=
"pageintro-99"></a>{Intro 99}</span> due to avidy&acirc;. But this
is just what we should like to see proved, and the proof offered in
no case amounts to more than a reference to the system which
demands that the S&ucirc;tras should be thus understood. If we
accept the interpretations of the school of <i>S</i>a@nkara, it
remains altogether unintelligible why the S&ucirc;trak&acirc;ra
should never hint even at what <i>S</i>a@nkara is anxious again and
again to point out at length, viz. that the greater part of the
work contains a kind of exoteric doctrine only, ever tending to
mislead the student who does not keep in view what its nature is.
If other reasons should make it probable that the
S&ucirc;trak&acirc;ra was anxious to hide the true doctrine of the
Upanishads as a sort of esoteric teaching, we might be more ready
to accept <i>S</i>a@nkara's mode of interpretation. But no such
reasons are forthcoming; nowhere among the avowed followers of the
<i>S</i>a@nkara system is there any tendency to treat the kernel of
their philosophy as something to be jealously guarded and hidden.
On the contrary, they all, from Gau<i>d</i>ap&acirc;da down to the
most modern writer, consider it their most important, nay, only
task to inculcate again and again in the clearest and most
unambiguous language that all appearance of multiplicity is a vain
illusion, that the Lord and the individual souls are in reality
one, and that all knowledge but this one knowledge is without true
value.</p>
<p>There remains one more important passage concerning the relation
of the individual soul to the highest Self, a passage which
attracted our attention above, when we were reviewing the evidence
for early divergence of opinion among the teachers of the
Ved&acirc;nta. I mean I, 4, 20-22, which three S&ucirc;tras state
the views of &Acirc;<i>s</i>marathya, Au<i>d</i>ulomi, and
K&acirc;<i>s</i>akr<i>ri</i>tsna as to the reason why, in a certain
passage of the B<i>ri</i>had&acirc;ra<i>n</i>yaka, characteristics
of the individual soul are ascribed to the highest Self. The
siddh&acirc;nta view is enounced in S&ucirc;tra 22, 'avasthiter iti
K&acirc;<i>s</i>ak<i>ri</i>tsna<i>h</i>' i.e.
K&acirc;<i>s</i>ak<i>ri</i>tsna (accounts for the circumstance
mentioned) on the ground of the 'permanent abiding or abode.' By
this 'permanent abiding' <i>S</i>a@nkara understands the Lord's
abiding as, i.e. existing as&mdash;or in the condition of&mdash;the
individual soul, and thus sees in the S&ucirc;tra an enunciation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-100" id=
"pageintro-100"></a>{Intro 100}</span> of his own view that the
individual soul is nothing but the highest Self,
'avik<i>ri</i>ta<i>h</i> parame<i>s</i>varo j&icirc;vo
n&acirc;nya<i>h</i>.' R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja on the other hand,
likewise accepting K&acirc;<i>s</i>ak<i>ri</i>tsna's opinion as the
siddh&acirc;nta view, explains 'avasthiti' as the Lord's permanent
abiding within the individual soul, as described in the
antary&acirc;min-br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a.&mdash;We can hardly
maintain that the term 'avasthiti' cannot have the meaning ascribed
to it by Sa@<i>n</i>kara, viz. special state or condition, but so
much must be urged in favour of R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja's
interpretation that in the five other places where avasthiti (or
anavasthiti) is met with in the S&ucirc;tras (I, 2, 17; II, 2, 4;
II, 2, 13; II, 3, 24; III, 3, 32) it regularly means permanent
abiding or permanent abode within something.</p>
<p>If, now, I am shortly to sum up the results of the preceding
enquiry as to the teaching of the S&ucirc;tras, I must give it as
my opinion that they do not set forth the distinction of a higher
and lower knowledge of Brahman; that they do not acknowledge the
distinction of Brahman and &Icirc;<i>s</i>vara in <i>S</i>a@nkara's
sense; that they do not hold the doctrine of the unreality of the
world; and that they do not, with <i>S</i>a@nkara, proclaim the
absolute identity of the individual and the highest Self. I do not
wish to advance for the present beyond these negative results. Upon
R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja's mode of interpretation&mdash;although I
accept it without reserve in some important details&mdash;I look on
the whole as more useful in providing us with a powerful means of
criticising <i>S</i>a@nkara's explanations than in guiding us
throughout to the right understanding of the text. The author of
the S&ucirc;tras may have held views about the nature of Brahman,
the world, and the soul differing from those of <i>S</i>a@nkara,
and yet not agreeing in all points with those of
R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja. If, however, the negative conclusions stated
above should be well founded, it would follow even from them that
the system of B&acirc;dar&acirc;ya<i>n</i>a had greater affinities
with that of the Bh&acirc;gavatas and R&acirc;manuja than with the
one of which the <i>S</i>a@nkara-bh&acirc;shya is the classical
exponent.</p>
<p>It appears from the above review of the teaching of the
S&ucirc;tras that only a comparatively very small proportion of
them contribute matter enabling us to form a judgment <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="pageintro-101" id="pageintro-101"></a>{Intro
101}</span> as to the nature of the philosophical doctrine
advocated by B&acirc;dar&acirc;ya<i>n</i>a. The reason of this is
that the greater part of the work is taken up with matters which,
according to <i>S</i>a@nkara's terminology, form part of the
so-called lower knowledge, and throw no light upon philosophical
questions in the stricter sense of the word. This circumstance is
not without significance. In later works belonging to
<i>S</i>a@nkara's school in which the distinction of a higher and
lower vidy&acirc; is clearly recognised, the topics constituting
the latter are treated with great shortness; and rightly so, for
they are unable to accomplish the highest aim of man, i.e. final
release. When we therefore, on the other hand, find that the
subjects of the so-called lower vidy&acirc; are treated very fully
in the Ved&acirc;nta-s&ucirc;tras, when we observe, for instance,
the almost tedious length to which the investigation of the unity
of vidy&acirc;s (most of which are so-called sagu<i>n</i>a, i.e.
lower vidy&acirc;s) is carried in the third adhy&acirc;ya, or the
fact of almost the whole fourth adhy&acirc;ya being devoted to the
ultimate fate of the possessor of the lower vidy&acirc;; we
certainly feel ourselves confirmed in our conclusion that what
<i>S</i>a@nkara looked upon as comparatively unimportant formed in
B&acirc;dar&acirc;ya<i>n</i>a's opinion part of that knowledge
higher than which there is none, and which therefore is entitled to
the fullest and most detailed exposition.</p>
<p>The question as to what kind of system is represented by the
Ved&acirc;nta-s&ucirc;tras may be approached in another way also.
While hitherto we have attempted to penetrate to the meaning of the
S&ucirc;tras by means of the different commentaries, we might try
the opposite road, and, in the first place, attempt to ascertain
independently of the S&ucirc;tras what doctrine is set forth in the
Upanishads, whose teaching the S&ucirc;tras doubtless aim at
systematising. If, it might be urged, the Upanishads can be
convincingly shown to embody a certain settled doctrine, we must
consider it at the least highly probable that that very same
doctrine&mdash;of whatever special nature it may be&mdash;is hidden
in the enigmatical aphorisms of
B&acirc;dar&acirc;ya<i>n</i>a.<a id="footnotetag24" name=
"footnotetag24"></a><a href="#footnote24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>I do not, however, consider this line of argumentation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-102" id=
"pageintro-102"></a>{Intro 102}</span> a safe one. Even if it could
be shown that the teaching of all the chief Upanishads agrees in
all essential points (a subject to which some attention will be
paid later on), we should not on that account be entitled
unhesitatingly to assume that the S&ucirc;tras set forth the same
doctrine. Whatever the true philosophy of the Upanishads may be,
there remains the undeniable fact that there exist and have existed
since very ancient times not one but several essentially differing
systems, all of which lay claim to the distinction of being the
true representatives of the teaching of the Upanishads as well as
of the S&ucirc;tras. Let us suppose, for argument's sake, that, for
instance, the doctrine of M&acirc;y&acirc; is distinctly enunciated
in the Upanishads; nevertheless R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja and, for all
we know to the contrary, the whole series of more ancient
commentators on whom he looked as authorities in the interpretation
of the S&ucirc;tras, denied that the Upanishads teach
M&acirc;y&acirc;, and it is hence by no means impossible that
B&acirc;dar&acirc;ya<i>n</i>a should have done the same. The
&agrave; priori style of reasoning as to the teaching of the
S&ucirc;tras is therefore without much force.</p>
<p>But apart from any intention of arriving thereby at the meaning
of the S&ucirc;tras there, of course, remains for us the
all-important question as to the true teaching of the Upanishads, a
question which a translator of the S&ucirc;tras and <i>S</i>a@nkara
cannot afford to pass over in silence, especially after reason has
been shown for the conclusion that the S&ucirc;tras and the
<i>S</i>a@nkara-bh&acirc;shya do not agree concerning most
important points of Ved&acirc;ntic doctrine. The S&ucirc;tras as
well as the later commentaries claim, in the first place, to be
nothing more than systematisations of the Upanishads, and for us a
considerable part at least of their value and interest lies in this
their nature. Hence the further question presents itself by whom
the teaching of the Upanishads has been most adequately
systematised, whether by B&acirc;dar&acirc;ya<i>n</i>a, or
<i>S</i>a@nkara, or R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja, or some other
commentator. This question requires to be kept altogether separate
from the enquiry as to which commentator most faithfully renders
the contents of the S&ucirc;tras, and it is by no means impossible
that <i>S</i>a@nkara, for instance, should in <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="pageintro-103" id="pageintro-103"></a>{Intro
103}</span> the end have to be declared a more trustworthy guide
with regard to the teaching of the Upanishads than concerning the
meaning of the S&ucirc;tras.</p>
<p>We must remark here at once that, whatever commentator may be
found to deserve preference on the whole, it appears fairly certain
already at the outset that none of the systems which Indian
ingenuity has succeeded in erecting on the basis of the Upanishads
can be accepted in its entirety. The reason for this lies in the
nature of the Upanishads themselves. To the Hindu commentator and
philosopher the Upanishads came down as a body of revealed truth
whose teaching had, somehow or other, to be shown to be thoroughly
consistent and free from contradictions; a system had to be devised
in which a suitable place could be allotted to every one of the
multitudinous statements which they make on the various points of
Ved&acirc;ntic doctrine. But to the European scholar, or in fact to
any one whose mind is not bound by the doctrine of <i>S</i>ruti, it
will certainly appear that all such attempts stand self-condemned.
If anything is evident even on a cursory review of the
Upanishads&mdash;and the impression so created is only strengthened
by a more careful investigation&mdash;it is that they do not
constitute a systematic whole. They themselves, especially the
older ones, give the most unmistakable indications on that point.
Not only are the doctrines expounded in the different Upanishads
ascribed to different teachers, but even the separate sections of
one and the same Upanishad are assigned to different authorities.
It would be superfluous to quote examples of what a mere look at
the Ch&acirc;ndogya Upanishad, for instance, suffices to prove. It
is of course not impossible that even a multitude of teachers
should agree in imparting precisely the same doctrine; but in the
case of the Upanishads that is certainly not antecedently probable.
For, in the first place, the teachers who are credited with the
doctrines of the Upanishads manifestly belonged to different
sections of Brahminical society, to different Vedic
<i>s</i>&acirc;kh&acirc;s; nay, some of them the tradition makes
out to have been kshattriyas. And, in the second place, the period,
whose <span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-104" id=
"pageintro-104"></a>{Intro 104}</span> mental activity is
represented in the Upanishads, was a creative one, and as such
cannot be judged according to the analogy of later periods of
Indian philosophic development. The later philosophic schools as,
for instance, the one of which <i>S</i>a@nkara is the great
representative, were no longer free in their speculations, but
strictly bound by a traditional body of texts considered sacred,
which could not be changed or added to, but merely systematised and
commented upon. Hence the rigorous uniformity of doctrine
characteristic of those schools. But there had been a time when,
what later writers received as a sacred legacy, determining and
confining the whole course of their speculations, first sprang from
the minds of creative thinkers not fettered by the tradition of any
school, but freely following the promptings of their own heads and
hearts. By the absence of school traditions, I do not indeed mean
that the great teachers who appear in the Upanishads were free to
make an entirely new start, and to assign to their speculations any
direction they chose; for nothing can be more certain than that, at
the period as the outcome of whose philosophical activity the
Upanishads have to be considered, there were in circulation certain
broad speculative ideas overshadowing the mind of every member of
Brahminical society. But those ideas were neither very definite nor
worked out in detail, and hence allowed themselves to be handled
and fashioned in different ways by different individuals. With whom
the few leading conceptions traceable in the teaching of all
Upanishads first originated, is a point on which those writings
themselves do not enlighten us, and which we have no other means
for settling; most probably they are to be viewed not as the
creation of any individual mind, but as the gradual outcome of
speculations carried on by generations of Vedic theologians. In the
Upanishads themselves, at any rate, they appear as floating mental
possessions which may be seized and moulded into new forms by any
one who feels within himself the required inspiration. A certain
vague knowledge of Brahman, the great hidden being in which all
this manifold world is one, seems to be <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="pageintro-105" id="pageintro-105"></a>{Intro
105}</span> spread everywhere, and often issues from the most
unexpected sources. <i>S</i>vetaketu receives instruction from his
father Udd&acirc;laka; the proud G&acirc;rgya has to become the
pupil of Aj&acirc;ta<i>s</i>atru, the king of
K&acirc;<i>s</i>&icirc;; Bhujyu S&acirc;hy&acirc;yani receives
answers to his questions from a Gandharva possessing a maiden;
Satyak&acirc;ma learns what Brahman is from the bull of the herd he
is tending, from Agni and from a flamingo; and Upako<i>s</i>ala is
taught by the sacred fires in his teacher's house. All this is of
course legend, not history; but the fact that the philosophic and
theological doctrines of the Upanishads are clothed in this
legendary garb certainly does not strengthen the expectation of
finding in them a rigidly systematic doctrine.</p>
<p>And a closer investigation of the contents of the Upanishads
amply confirms this preliminary impression. If we avail ourselves,
for instance, of M. Paul R&eacute;gnaud's Mat&eacute;riaux pour
servir &agrave; l'Histoire de la Philosophie de l'Inde, in which
the philosophical lucubrations of the different Upanishads are
arranged systematically according to topics, we can see with ease
how, together with a certain uniformity of general leading
conceptions, there runs throughout divergence in details, and very
often not unimportant details. A look, for instance, at the
collection of passages relative to the origination of the world
from the primitive being, suffices to show that the task of
demonstrating that whatever the Upanishads teach on that point can
be made to fit into a homogeneous system is an altogether hopeless
one. The accounts there given of the creation belong, beyond all
doubt to different stages of philosophic and theological
development or else to different sections of priestly society. None
but an Indian commentator would, I suppose, be inclined and
sufficiently courageous to attempt the proof that, for instance,
the legend of the &acirc;tman purushavidha, the Self in the shape
of a person which is as large as man and woman together, and then
splits itself into two halves from which cows, horses, asses,
goats, &amp;c. are produced in succession (B<i>ri</i>. Up. I, 1,
4), can be reconciled with the account given of the creation in the
Ch&acirc;ndogya Upanishad, where it is said that in the beginning
there existed nothing but the sat, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"pageintro-106" id="pageintro-106"></a>{Intro 106}</span> 'that
which is,' and that feeling a desire of being many it emitted out
of itself ether, and then all the other elements in due succession.
The former is a primitive cosmogonic myth, which in its details
shows striking analogies with the cosmogonic myths of other
nations; the latter account is fairly developed Ved&acirc;nta
(although not Ved&acirc;nta implying the M&acirc;y&acirc;
doctrine). We may admit that both accounts show a certain
fundamental similarity in so far as they derive the manifold world
from one original being; but to go beyond this and to maintain, as
<i>S</i>a@nkara does, that the &acirc;tman purushavidha of the
B<i>ri</i>had&acirc;ra<i>n</i>yaka is the so-called Vir&acirc;g of
the latter Ved&acirc;nta&mdash;implying thereby that that section
consciously aims at describing only the activity of one special
form of &Icirc;<i>s</i>vara, and not simply the whole process of
creation&mdash;is the ingenious shift of an orthodox commentator in
difficulties, but nothing more.</p>
<p>How all those more or less conflicting texts came to be
preserved and handed down to posterity, is not difficult to
understand. As mentioned above, each of the great sections of
Brahminical priesthood had its own sacred texts, and again in each
of those sections there existed more ancient texts which it was
impossible to discard when deeper and more advanced speculations
began in their turn to be embodied in literary compositions, which
in the course of time likewise came to be looked upon as sacred.
When the creative period had reached its termination, and the task
of collecting and arranging was taken in hand, older and newer
pieces were combined into wholes, and thus there arose collections
of such heterogeneous character as the Ch&acirc;ndogya and
B<i>ri</i>had&acirc;ra<i>n</i>yaka Upanishads. On later
generations, to which the whole body of texts came down as revealed
truth, there consequently devolved the inevitable task of
establishing systems on which no exception could be taken to any of
the texts; but that the task was, strictly speaking, an impossible
one, i.e. one which it was impossible to accomplish fairly and
honestly, there really is no reason to deny.</p>
<p>For a comprehensive criticism of the methods which the different
commentators employ in systematizing the contents <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="pageintro-107" id="pageintro-107"></a>{Intro
107}</span> of the Upanishads there is no room in this place. In
order, however, to illustrate what is meant by the 'impossibility,'
above alluded to, of combining the various doctrines of the
Upanishads into a whole without doing violence to a certain number
of texts, it will be as well to analyse in detail some few at least
of <i>S</i>a@nkara's interpretations, and to render clear the
considerations by which he is guided.</p>
<p>We begin with a case which has already engaged our attention
when discussing the meaning of the S&ucirc;tras, viz. the question
concerning the ultimate fate of those who have attained the
knowledge of Brahman. As we have seen, <i>S</i>a@nkara teaches that
the soul of him who has risen to an insight into the nature of the
higher Brahman does not, at the moment of death, pass out of the
body, but is directly merged in Brahman by a process from which all
departing and moving, in fact all considerations of space, are
altogether excluded. The soul of him, on the other hand, who has
not risen above the knowledge of the lower qualified Brahman
departs from the body by means of the artery called
sushum<i>n</i>&acirc;, and following the so-called devay&acirc;na,
the path of the gods, mounts up to the world of Brahman. A review
of the chief Upanishad texts on which <i>S</i>a@nkara founds this
distinction will show how far it is justified.</p>
<p>In a considerable number of passages the Upanishads contrast the
fate of two classes of men, viz. of those who perform sacrifices
and meritorious works only, and of those who in addition possess a
certain kind of knowledge. Men of the former kind ascend after
death to the moon, where they live for a certain time, and then
return to the earth into new forms of embodiment; persons of the
latter kind proceed on the path of the gods&mdash;on which the sun
forms one stage&mdash;up to the world of Brahman, from which there
is no return. The chief passages to that effect are Ch. Up. V, 10;
Kaush. Up. I, 2 ff.; Mu<i>nd</i>. Up. I, 2, 9 ff.; B<i>ri</i>. Up.
VI, 2, 15 ff.; Pra<i>s</i>na Up. I, 9 ff.&mdash;In other passages
only the latter of the two paths is referred to, cp. Ch. Up. IV,
15; VIII 6, 5; Taitt. Up. I, 6; B<i>ri</i>. Up. IV, 4, 8, 9; V, 10;
Maitr. Up. VI, 30, to mention only the more important ones.</p>
<p>Now an impartial consideration of those passages shows
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-108" id=
"pageintro-108"></a>{Intro 108}</span> I think, beyond any doubt,
that what is meant there by the knowledge which leads through the
sun to the world of Brahman is the highest knowledge of which the
devotee is capable, and that the world of Brahman to which his
knowledge enables him to proceed denotes the highest state which he
can ever reach, the state of final release, if we choose to call it
by that name.&mdash;Ch. Up. V, 10 says, 'Those who know this (viz.
the doctrine of the five fires), and those who in the forest follow
faith and austerities go to light,' &amp;c.&mdash;Ch. Up. IV, 15 is
manifestly intended to convey the true knowledge of Brahman;
Upako<i>s</i>ala's teacher himself represents the instruction given
by him as superior to the teaching of the sacred fires.&mdash;Ch.
Up. VIII, 6, 5 quotes the old <i>s</i>loka which says that the man
moving upwards by the artery penetrating the crown of the head
reaches the Immortal.&mdash;Kaush. Up. I, 2&mdash;which gives the
most detailed account of the ascent of the soul&mdash;contains no
intimation whatever of the knowledge of Brahman, which leads up to
the Brahman world, being of an inferior nature.&mdash;Mu<i>nd</i>.
Up. I, 2, 9 agrees with the Ch&acirc;ndogya in saying that 'Those
who practise penance and faith in the forest, tranquil, wise, and
living on alms, depart free from passion, through the sun, to where
that immortal Person dwells whose nature is imperishable,' and
nothing whatever in the context countenances the assumption that
not the highest knowledge and the highest Person are there referred
to.&mdash;B<i>ri</i>. Up. IV, 4, 8 quotes old <i>s</i>lokas clearly
referring to the road of the gods ('the small old path'), on which
'sages who know Brahman move on to the svargaloka and thence higher
on as entirely free.&mdash;That path was found by Brahman, and on
it goes whoever knows Brahman.'&mdash;B<i>ri</i>. Up. VI, 2, 15 is
another version of the Pa<i>&ntilde;k</i>&acirc;gnividy&acirc;,
with the variation, 'Those who know this, and those who in the
forest worship faith and the True, go to light,'
&amp;c.&mdash;Pra<i>s</i>na Up. 1, 10 says, 'Those who have sought
the Self by penance, abstinence, faith, and knowledge gain by the
northern path &Acirc;ditya, the sun. There is the home of the
spirits, the immortal free from danger, the highest. From thence
they do not return, for it is the end.'&mdash;Maitr. Up. VI, 30
quotes <span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-109" id=
"pageintro-109"></a>{Intro 109}</span> <i>s</i>lokas, 'One of them
(the arteries) leads upwards, piercing the solar orb: by it, having
stepped beyond the world of Brahman, they go to the highest
path.'</p>
<p>All these passages are as clear as can be desired. The soul of
the sage who knows Brahman passes out by the sushum<i>n</i>&acirc;,
and ascends by the path of the gods to the world of Brahman, there
to remain for ever in some blissful state. But, according to
<i>S</i>a@nkara, all these texts are meant to set forth the result
of a certain inferior knowledge only, of the knowledge of the
conditioned Brahman. Even in a passage apparently so entirely
incapable of more than one interpretation as B<i>ri</i>. Up. VI, 2,
15, the 'True,' which the holy hermits in the forest are said to
worship, is not to be the highest Brahman, but only
Hira<i>n</i>yagarbha!&mdash;And why?&mdash;Only because the system
so demands it, the system which teaches that those who know the
highest Brahman become on their death one with it, without having
to resort to any other place. The passage on which this latter
tenet is chiefly based is B<i>ri</i>. Up. IV, 4, 6, 7, where, with
the fate of him who at his death has desires, and whose soul
therefore enters a new body after having departed from the old one,
accompanied by all the pr&acirc;<i>n</i>as, there is contrasted the
fate of the sage free from all desires. 'But as to the man who does
not desire, who not desiring, freed from desires is satisfied in
his desires, or desires the Self only, the vital spirits of him
(tasya) do not depart&mdash;being Brahman he goes to Brahman.'</p>
<p>We have seen above (p. lxxx) that this passage is referred to in
the important S&ucirc;tras on whose right interpretation it, in the
first place, depends whether or not we must admit the
S&ucirc;trak&acirc;ra to have acknowledged the distinction of a
par&acirc; and an apar&acirc; vidy&acirc;. Here the passage
interests us as throwing light on the way in which <i>S</i>a@nkara
systematises. He looks on the preceding part of the chapter as
describing what happens to the souls of all those who do not know
the highest Brahman, inclusive of those who know the lower Brahman
only. They pass out of the old bodies followed by all
pr&acirc;<i>n</i>as and enter new bodies. He, on the other hand,
section 6 continues, who knows the true Brahman, does not pass out
of the body, but becomes one with Brahman then <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="pageintro-110" id="pageintro-110"></a>{Intro
110}</span> and there. This interpretation of the purport of the
entire chapter is not impossibly right, although I am rather
inclined to think that the chapter aims at setting forth in its
earlier part the future of him who does not know Brahman at all,
while the latter part of section 6 passes on to him who does know
Brahman (i.e. Brahman pure and simple, the text knowing of no
distinction of the so-called lower and higher Brahman). In
explaining section 6 <i>S</i>a@nkara lays stress upon the clause
'na tasya pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a utkr&acirc;manti,' 'his vital spirits
do not pass out,' taking this to signify that the soul with the
vital spirits does not move at all, and thus does not ascend to the
world of Brahman; while the purport of the clause may simply be
that the soul and vital spirits do not go anywhere else, i.e. do
not enter a new body, but are united, somehow or other, with
Brahman. On <i>S</i>a@nkara's interpretation there immediately
arises a new difficulty. In the <i>s</i>lokas, quoted under
sections 8 and 9, the description of the small old path which leads
to the svargaloka and higher on clearly refers&mdash;as noticed
already above&mdash;to the path through the veins, primarily the
sushum<i>n</i>&acirc;, on which, according to so many other
passages, the soul of the wise mounts upwards. But that path is,
according to <i>S</i>a@nkara, followed by him only who has not
risen above the lower knowledge, and yet the <i>s</i>lokas have
manifestly to be connected with what is said in the latter half of
6 about the owner of the par&acirc; vidy&acirc;. Hence
<i>S</i>a@nkara sees himself driven to explain the <i>s</i>lokas in
8 and 9 (of which a faithful translation is given in Professor Max
M&uuml;ller's version) as follows:</p>
<p>8. 'The subtle old path (i.e. the path of knowledge on which
final release is reached; which path is subtle, i.e. difficult to
know, and old, i.e. to be known from the eternal Veda) has been
obtained and fully reached by me. On it the sages who know Brahman
reach final release (svargaloka<i>s</i>abda<i>h</i>
samnihitaprakara<i>n</i>&acirc;t
moksh&acirc;bhidh&acirc;yaka<i>h</i>).</p>
<p>9. 'On that path they say that there is white or blue or yellow
or green or red (i.e. others maintain that the path to final
release is, in accordance with the colour of the arteries, either
white or blue, &amp;c.; but that is false, for the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="pageintro-111" id="pageintro-111"></a>{Intro
111}</span> paths through the arteries lead at the best to the
world of Brahman, which itself forms part of the
sa<i>m</i>s&acirc;ra); that path (i.e. the only path to release,
viz. the path of true knowledge) is found by Brahman, i.e. by such
Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>as as through true knowledge have become like
Brahman,' &amp;c.</p>
<p>A significant instance in truth of the straits to which
thorough-going systematisers of the Upanishads see themselves
reduced occasionally!</p>
<p>But we return to the point which just now chiefly interests us.
Whether <i>S</i>a@nkara's interpretation of the chapter, and
especially of section 6, be right or wrong, so much is certain that
we are not entitled to view all those texts which speak of the soul
going to the world of Brahman as belonging to the so-called lower
knowledge, because a few other passages declare that the sage does
not go to Brahman. The text which declares the sage free from
desires to become one with Brahman could not, without due
discrimination, be used to define and limit the meaning of other
passages met with in the same Upanishad even&mdash;for as we have
remarked above the B<i>ri</i>had&acirc;ra<i>n</i>yaka contains
pieces manifestly belonging to different stages of
development;&mdash;much less does it entitle us to put arbitrary
constructions on passages forming part of other Upanishads.
Historically the disagreement of the various accounts is easy to
understand. The older notion was that the soul of the wise man
proceeds along the path of the gods to Brahman's abode. A
later&mdash;and, if we like, more philosophic&mdash;conception is
that, as Brahman already is a man's Self, there is no need of any
motion on man's part to reach Brahman. We may even apply to those
two views the terms apar&acirc; and par&acirc;&mdash;lower and
higher&mdash;knowledge. But we must not allow any commentator to
induce us to believe that what he from his advanced standpoint
looks upon as an inferior kind of cognition, was viewed in the same
light by the authors of the Upanishads.</p>
<p>We turn to another Upanishad text likewise touching upon the
point considered in what precedes, viz. the second
Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a of the third adhy&acirc;ya of the
B<i>ri</i>had&acirc;ra<i>n</i>yaka. The discussion there first
turns upon the grahas and atigrahas, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"pageintro-112" id="pageintro-112"></a>{Intro 112}</span> i.e. the
senses and organs and their objects, and Y&acirc;j&ntilde;avalkya
thereupon explains that death, by which everything is overcome, is
itself overcome by water; for death is fire. The colloquy then
turns to what we must consider an altogether new topic,
&Acirc;rtabh&acirc;ga asking, 'When this man (ayam purusha) dies,
do the vital spirits depart from him or not?' and
Y&acirc;j&ntilde;avalkya answering, 'No, they are gathered up in
him; he swells, he is inflated; inflated the dead (body) is
lying.'&mdash;Now this is for <i>S</i>a@nkara an important passage,
as we have already seen above (p. lxxxi); for he employs it, in his
comment on Ved.-s&ucirc;tra IV, 2, 13, for the purpose of proving
that the passage B<i>ri</i>. Up. IV, 4, 6 really means that the
vital spirits do not, at the moment of death, depart from the true
sage. Hence the present passage also must refer to him who
possesses the highest knowledge; hence the 'ayam purusha' must be
'that man,' i.e. the man who possesses the highest knowledge, and
the highest knowledge then must be found in the preceding clause
which says that death itself may be conquered by water. But, as
R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja also remarks, neither does the context favour
the assumption that the highest knowledge is referred to, nor do
the words of section 11 contain any indication that what is meant
is the merging of the Self of the true Sage in Brahman. With the
interpretation given by R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja himself, viz. that the
pr&acirc;<i>n</i>as do not depart from the j&icirc;va of the dying
man, but accompany it into a new body, I can agree as little
(although he no doubt rightly explains the 'ayam purusha' by 'man'
in general), and am unable to see in the passage anything more than
a crude attempt to account for the fact that a dead body appears
swollen and inflated.&mdash;A little further on (section 13)
&Acirc;rtabh&acirc;ga asks what becomes of this man (ayam purusha)
when his speech has entered into the fire, his breath into the air,
his eye into the sun, &amp;c. So much here is clear that we have no
right to understand by the 'ayam purusha' of section 13 anybody
different from the 'ayam purusha' of the two preceding sections; in
spite of this <i>S</i>a@nkara&mdash;according to whose system the
organs of the true sage do not enter into the elements, but are
directly <span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-113" id=
"pageintro-113"></a>{Intro 113}</span> merged in
Brahman&mdash;explains the 'ayam purusha' of section 13 to be the
'asa<i>m</i>yagdar<i>s</i>in,' i.e. the person who has not risen to
the cognition of the highest Brahman. And still a further limiting
interpretation is required by the system. The
asa<i>m</i>yagdar<i>s</i>in also&mdash;who as such has to remain in
the sa<i>m</i>s&acirc;ra&mdash;cannot do without the organs, since
his j&icirc;va when passing out of the old body into a new one is
invested with the subtle body; hence section 13 cannot be taken as
saying what it clearly does say, viz. that at death the different
organs pass into the different elements, but as merely indicating
that the organs are abandoned by the divinities which, during
lifetime, presided over them!</p>
<p>The whole third adhy&acirc;ya indeed of the
B<i>ri</i>had&acirc;ra<i>n</i>yaka affords ample proof of the
artificial character of <i>S</i>a@nkara's attempts to show that the
teaching of the Upanishads follows a definite system. The eighth
br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a, for instance, is said to convey the doctrine
of the highest non-related Brahman, while the preceding
br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>as had treated only of &Icirc;<i>s</i>vara in
his various aspects. But, as a matter of fact,
br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a 8, after having, in section 8, represented
Brahman as destitute of all qualities, proceeds, in the next
section, to describe that very same Brahman as the ruler of the
world, 'By the command of that Imperishable sun and moon stand
apart,' &amp;c.; a clear indication that the author of the
Upanishad does not distinguish a higher and lower Brahman
in&mdash;<i>S</i>a@nkara's sense.&mdash;The preceding
br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a (7) treats of the antary&acirc;min, i.e.
Brahman viewed as the internal ruler of everything. This, according
to <i>S</i>a@nkara, is the lower form of Brahman called
&Icirc;<i>s</i>vara; but we observe that the antary&acirc;min as
well as the so-called highest Brahman described in section 8 is, at
the termination of the two sections, characterised by means of the
very same terms (7, 23: Unseen but seeing, unheard but hearing,
&amp;c. There is no other seer but he, there is no other hearer but
he, &amp;c.; and 8, 11: That Brahman is unseen but seeing, unheard
but hearing, &amp;c. There is nothing that sees but it, nothing
that hears but it, &amp;c.).&mdash;Nothing can be clearer than that
all these sections aim at describing one and the same being, and
know nothing of the distinctions made by the developed <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="pageintro-114" id="pageintro-114"></a>{Intro
114}</span> Ved&acirc;nta, however valid the latter may be from a
purely philosophic point of view.</p>
<p>We may refer to one more similar instance from the
Ch&acirc;ndogya Upanishad. We there meet in III, 14 with one of the
most famous vidy&acirc;s describing the nature of Brahman, called
after its reputed author the S&acirc;<i>nd</i>ilya-vidy&acirc;.
This small vidy&acirc; is decidedly one of the finest and most
characteristic texts; it would be difficult to point out another
passage setting forth with greater force and eloquence and in an
equally short compass the central doctrine of the Upanishads. Yet
this text, which, beyond doubt, gives utterance to the highest
conception of Brahman's nature that S&acirc;<i>nd</i>ilya's thought
was able to reach, is by <i>S</i>a@nkara and his school again
declared to form part of the lower vidy&acirc; only, because it
represents Brahman as possessing qualities. It is, according to
their terminology, not j<i>&ntilde;</i>&acirc;na, i.e. knowledge,
but the injunction of a mere up&acirc;san&acirc;, a devout
meditation on Brahman in so far as possessing certain definite
attributes such as having light for its form, having true thoughts,
and so on. The R&acirc;m&acirc;nujas, on the other hand, quote this
text with preference as clearly describing the nature of their
highest, i.e. their one Brahman. We again allow that
<i>S</i>a@nkara is free to deny that any text which ascribes
qualities to Brahman embodies absolute truth; but we also again
remark that there is no reason whatever for supposing that
S&acirc;<i>nd</i>ilya, or whoever may have been the author of that
vidy&acirc;, looked upon it as anything else but a statement of the
highest truth accessible to man.</p>
<p>We return to the question as to the true philosophy of the
Upanishads, apart from the systems of the commentators.&mdash;From
what precedes it will appear with sufficient distinctness that, if
we understand by philosophy a philosophical system coherent in all
its parts, free from all contradictions and allowing room for all
the different statements made in all the chief Upanishads, a
philosophy of the Upanishads cannot even be spoken of. The various
lucubrations on Brahman, the world, and the human soul of which the
Upanishads consist do not allow themselves to be systematised
simply because they were never meant to <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="pageintro-115" id="pageintro-115"></a>{Intro
115}</span> form a system. <i>S</i>&acirc;<i>nd</i>ilya's views as
to the nature of Brahman did not in all details agree with those of
Y&acirc;j<i>&ntilde;</i>avalkya, and Udd&acirc;laka differed from
both. In this there is nothing to wonder at, and the burden of
proof rests altogether with those who maintain that a large number
of detached philosophic and theological dissertations, ascribed to
different authors, doubtless belonging to different periods, and
not seldom manifestly contradicting each other, admit of being
combined into a perfectly consistent whole.</p>
<p>The question, however, assumes a different aspect, if we take
the terms 'philosophy' and 'philosophical system,' not in the
strict sense in which <i>S</i>a@nkara and other commentators are
not afraid of taking them, but as implying merely an agreement in
certain fundamental features. In this latter sense we may indeed
undertake to indicate the outlines of a philosophy of the
Upanishads, only keeping in view that precision in details is not
to be aimed at. And here we finally see ourselves driven back
altogether on the texts themselves, and have to acknowledge that
the help we receive from commentators, to whatever school they may
belong, is very inconsiderable. Fortunately it cannot be asserted
that the texts on the whole oppose very serious difficulties to a
right understanding, however obscure the details often are.
Concerning the latter we occasionally depend entirely on the
explanations vouchsafed by the scholiasts, but as far as the
general drift and spirit of the texts are concerned, we are quite
able to judge by ourselves, and are even specially qualified to do
so by having no particular system to advocate.</p>
<p>The point we will first touch upon is the same from which we
started when examining the doctrine of the S&ucirc;tras, viz. the
question whether the Upanishads acknowledge a higher and lower
knowledge in <i>S</i>a@nkara's sense, i.e. a knowledge of a higher
and a lower Brahman. Now this we find not to be the case. Knowledge
is in the Upanishads frequently opposed to av&icirc;dy&acirc;, by
which latter term we have to understand ignorance as to Brahman,
absence of philosophic knowledge; and, again, in several places we
find the knowledge of the sacrificial part of the Veda with its
supplementary <span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-116" id=
"pageintro-116"></a>{Intro 116}</span> disciplines contrasted as
inferior with the knowledge of the Self; to which latter
distinction the Mu<i>nd</i>aka Up. (I, 4) applies the terms
apar&acirc; and par&acirc; v&icirc;dy&acirc;. But a formal
recognition of the essential difference of Brahman being viewed, on
the one hand, as possessing distinctive attributes, and, on the
other hand, as devoid of all such attributes is not to be met with
anywhere. Brahman is indeed sometimes described as sagu<i>n</i>a
and sometimes as nirgu<i>n</i>a (to use later terms); but it is
nowhere said that thereon rests a distinction of two different
kinds of knowledge leading to altogether different results. The
knowledge of Brahman is one, under whatever aspects it is viewed;
hence the circumstance (already exemplified above) that in the same
vidy&acirc;s it is spoken of as sagu<i>n</i>a as well as
nirgu<i>n</i>a. When the mind of the writer dwells on the fact that
Brahman is that from which all this world originates, and in which
it rests, he naturally applies to it distinctive attributes
pointing at its relation to the world; Brahman, then, is called the
Self and life of all, the inward ruler, the omniscient Lord, and so
on. When, on the other hand, the author follows out the idea that
Brahman may be viewed in itself as the mysterious reality of which
the whole expanse of the world is only an outward manifestation,
then it strikes him that no idea or term derived from sensible
experience can rightly be applied to it, that nothing more may be
predicated of it but that it is neither this nor that. But these
are only two aspects of the cognition of one and the same
entity.</p>
<p>Closely connected with the question as to the double nature of
the Brahman of the Upanishads is the question as to their teaching
M&acirc;y&acirc;.&mdash;From Colebrooke downwards the majority of
European writers have inclined towards the opinion that the
doctrine of M&acirc;y&acirc;, i.e. of the unreal illusory character
of the sensible world, does not constitute a feature of the
primitive philosophy of the Upanishads, but was introduced into the
system at some later period, whether by
B&acirc;dar&acirc;ya<i>n</i>a or <i>S</i>a@nkara or somebody else.
The opposite view, viz. that the doctrine of M&acirc;y&acirc; forms
an integral element of the teaching of the Upanishads, is implied
in them everywhere, and enunciated more or less distinctly in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-117" id=
"pageintro-117"></a>{Intro 117}</span> more than one place, has in
recent times been advocated with much force by Mr. Gough in the
ninth chapter of his Philosophy of the Upanishads.</p>
<p>In his Mat&eacute;riaux, &amp;c. M. Paul R&eacute;gnaud remarks
that 'the doctrine of M&acirc;y&acirc;, although implied in the
teaching of the Upanishads, could hardly become clear and explicit
before the system had reached a stage of development necessitating
a choice between admitting two co-existent eternal principles
(which became the basis of the S&acirc;@nkhya philosophy), and
accepting the predominance of the intellectual principle, which in
the end necessarily led to the negation of the opposite
principle.'&mdash;To the two alternatives here referred to as
possible we, however, have to add a third one, viz. that form of
the Ved&acirc;nta of which the theory of the Bh&acirc;gavatas or
R&acirc;m&acirc;nujas is the most eminent type, and according to
which Brahman carries within its own nature an element from which
the material universe originates; an element which indeed is not an
independent entity like the pradh&acirc;na of the S&acirc;@nkhyas,
but which at the same time is not an unreal M&acirc;y&acirc; but
quite as real as any other part of Brahman's nature. That a
doctrine of this character actually developed itself on the basis
of the Upanishads, is a circumstance which we clearly must not lose
sight of, when attempting to determine what the Upanishads
themselves are teaching concerning the character of the world.</p>
<p>In enquiring whether the Upanishads maintain the
M&acirc;y&acirc; doctrine or not, we must proceed with the same
caution as regards other parts of the system, i.e. we must refrain
from using unhesitatingly, and without careful consideration of the
merits of each individual case, the teaching&mdash;direct or
inferred&mdash;of any one passage to the end of determining the
drift of the teaching of other passages. We may admit that some
passages, notably of the B<i>ri</i>had&acirc;ra<i>n</i>yaka,
contain at any rate the germ of the later developed
M&acirc;y&acirc; doctrine<a id="footnotetag25" name=
"footnotetag25"></a><a href="#footnote25"><sup>25</sup></a>, and
thus render it quite intelligible that a system like
<i>S</i>a@nkara's <span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-118" id=
"pageintro-118"></a>{Intro 118}</span> should evolve itself, among
others, out of the Upanishads; but that affords no valid reason for
interpreting M&acirc;y&acirc; into other texts which give a very
satisfactory sense without that doctrine, or are even clearly
repugnant to it. This remark applies in the very first place to all
the accounts of the creation of the physical universe. There, if
anywhere, the illusional character of the world should have been
hinted at, at least, had that theory been held by the authors of
those accounts; but not a word to that effect is met with anywhere.
The most important of those accounts&mdash;the one given in the
sixth chapter of the Ch&acirc;ndogya Upanishad&mdash;forms no
exception. There is absolutely no reason to assume that the
'sending forth' of the elements from the primitive Sat, which is
there described at length, was by the writer of that passage meant
to represent a vivarta rather than a pari<i>n</i>&acirc;ma that the
process of the origination of the physical universe has to be
conceived as anything else but a real manifestation of real powers
hidden in the primeval Self. The introductory words, addressed to
<i>S</i>vetaketu by Udd&acirc;laka, which are generally appealed to
as intimating the unreal character of the evolution about to be
described, do not, if viewed impartially, intimate any such
thing<a id="footnotetag26" name="footnotetag26"></a><a href=
"#footnote26"><sup>26</sup></a>. For what is capable of being
proved, and manifestly meant to be proved, by the illustrative
instances of the lump of clay and the nugget of gold, through which
there are known all things made of clay and gold? Merely that this
whole world has Brahman for its causal substance, just as clay is
the causal matter of every earthen pot, and gold of every golden
ornament, but not that the process through which any causal
substance becomes an effect is an unreal one. We&mdash;including
Udd&acirc;laka&mdash;may surely say that all earthen pots are in
reality nothing but earth&mdash;the earthen pot being merely a
special modification (vik&acirc;ra) of clay which has a name of its
own&mdash;without thereby committing ourselves to the doctrine that
the change of form, which a lump of clay undergoes when being
fashioned into a pot, is not real but a mere baseless illusion.</p>
<p>In the same light we have to view numerous other passages
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-119" id=
"pageintro-119"></a>{Intro 119}</span> which set forth the
successive emanations proceeding from the first principle. When,
for instance, we meet in the Ka<i>th</i>a Up. I, 3, 10, in the
serial enumeration of the forms of existence intervening between
the gross material world and the highest Self (the Person), with
the 'avy&acirc;k<i>ri</i>ta,' the Undeveloped, immediately below
the purusha; and when again the Mu<i>nd</i>aka Up. II, 1, 2, speaks
of the 'high Imperishable' higher than which is the heavenly
Person; there is no reason whatever to see in that 'Undeveloped'
and that 'high Imperishable' anything but that real element in
Brahman from which, as in the R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja system, the
material universe springs by a process of real development. We must
of course render it quite clear to ourselves in what sense the
terms 'real' and 'unreal' have to be understood. The Upanishads no
doubt teach emphatically that the material world does not owe its
existence to any principle independent from the Lord like the
pradh&acirc;na of the S&acirc;@nkhyas; the world is nothing but a
manifestation of the Lord's wonderful power, and hence is
unsubstantial, if we take the term 'substance' in its strict sense.
And, again, everything material is immeasurably inferior in nature
to the highest spiritual principle from which it has emanated, and
which it now hides from the individual soul. But neither
unsubstantiality nor inferiority of the kind mentioned constitutes
unreality in the sense in which the M&acirc;y&acirc; of
<i>S</i>a@nkara is unreal. According to the latter the whole world
is nothing but an erroneous appearance, as unreal as the snake, for
which a piece of rope is mistaken by the belated traveller, and
disappearing just as the imagined snake does as soon as the light
of true knowledge has risen. But this is certainly not the
impression left on the mind by a comprehensive review of the
Upanishads which dwells on their general scope, and does not
confine itself to the undue urging of what may be implied in some
detached passages. The Upanishads do not call upon us to look upon
the whole world as a baseless illusion to be destroyed by
knowledge; the great error which they admonish us to relinquish is
rather that things have a separate individual existence, and are
not tied together by the bond of being all of them effects
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-120" id=
"pageintro-120"></a>{Intro 120}</span> of Brahman, or Brahman
itself. They do not say that true knowledge sublates this false
world, as <i>S</i>a@nkara says, but that it enables the sage to
extricate himself from the world&mdash;the inferior m&ucirc;rta
r&ucirc;pa of Brahman, to use an expression of the
B<i>ri</i>had&acirc;ra<i>n</i>yaka&mdash;and to become one with
Brahman in its highest form. 'We are to see everything in Brahman,
and Brahman in everything;' the natural meaning of this is, 'we are
to look upon this whole world as a true manifestation of Brahman,
as sprung from it and animated by it.' The
m&acirc;y&acirc;v&acirc;din has indeed appropriated the above
saying also, and interpreted it so as to fall in with his theory;
but he is able to do so only by perverting its manifest sense. For
him it would be appropriate to say, not that everything we see is
in Brahman, but rather that everything we see is out of Brahman,
viz. as a false appearance spread over it and hiding it from
us.</p>
<p>Stress has been laid<a id="footnotetag27" name=
"footnotetag27"></a><a href="#footnote27"><sup>27</sup></a> upon
certain passages of the B<i>ri</i>had&acirc;ra<i>n</i>yaka which
seem to hint at the unreality of this world by qualifying terms,
indicative of duality or plurality of existence, by means of an
added 'iva,' i.e. 'as it were' (yatr&acirc;nyad iva sy&acirc;t;
yatra dvaitam iva bhavati; &acirc;tm&acirc; dhy&acirc;yat&icirc;va
lel&acirc;yat&icirc;va). Those passages no doubt readily lend
themselves to M&acirc;y&acirc; interpretations, and it is by no
means impossible that in their author's mind there was something
like an undeveloped M&acirc;y&acirc; doctrine. I must, however,
remark that they, on the other hand, also admit of easy
interpretations not in any way presupposing the theory of the
unreality of the world. If Y&acirc;j<i>&ntilde;</i>avalkya refers
to the latter as that 'where there is something else as it were,
where there is duality as it were,' he may simply mean to indicate
that the ordinary opinion, according to which the individual forms
of existence of the world are opposed to each other as altogether
separate, is a mistaken one, all things being one in so far as they
spring from&mdash;and are parts of&mdash;Brahman. This would in no
way involve duality or plurality being unreal in <i>S</i>a@nkara's
sense, not any more than, for instance, the modes of Spinoza are
unreal because, according to that philosopher, there is only one
universal <span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-121" id=
"pageintro-121"></a>{Intro 121}</span> substance. And with regard
to the clause 'the Self thinks as it were' it has to be noted that
according to the commentators the 'as it were' is meant to indicate
that truly not the Self is thinking, but the upadhis, i.e.
especially the manas with which the Self is connected. But whether
these upadhis are the mere offspring of M&acirc;y&acirc;, as
<i>S</i>a@nkara thinks, or real forms of existence, as
R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja teaches, is an altogether different
question.</p>
<p>I do not wish, however, to urge these last observations, and am
ready to admit that not impossibly those iva's indicate that the
thought of the writer who employed them was darkly labouring with a
conception akin to&mdash;although much less explicit than&mdash;the
M&acirc;y&acirc; of <i>S</i>a@nkara. But what I object to is, that
conclusions drawn from a few passages of, after all, doubtful
import should be employed for introducing the M&acirc;y&acirc;
doctrine into other passages which do not even hint at it, and are
fully intelligible without it.<a id="footnotetag28" name=
"footnotetag28"></a><a href="#footnote28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>The last important point in the teaching of the Upanishads we
have to touch upon is the relation of the j&icirc;vas, the
individual souls to the highest Self. The special views regarding
that point held by <i>S</i>a@nkara and R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja, as
have been stated before. Confronting their theories with the texts
of the Upanishads we must, I think, admit without hesitation, that
<i>S</i>a@nkara's doctrine faithfully represents the prevailing
teaching of the Upanishads in one important point at least, viz.
therein that the soul or Self of the sage&mdash;whatever its
original relation to Brahman may be&mdash;is in the end completely
merged and indistinguishably lost in the universal Self. A
distinction, repeatedly alluded to before, has indeed to be kept in
view here also. Certain texts of the Upanishads describe the soul's
going upwards, on the path of the gods, to the world of Brahman,
where it dwells for unnumbered years, i.e. for ever. Those texts,
as a type of which we may take, the passage Kaush&icirc;t. Up.
I&mdash;the fundamental text of the R&acirc;m&acirc;nujas
concerning the soul's <span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-122"
id="pageintro-122"></a>{Intro 122}</span> fate after
death&mdash;belong to an earlier stage of philosophic development;
they manifestly ascribe to the soul a continued individual
existence. But mixed with texts of this class there are others in
which the final absolute identification of the individual Self with
the universal Self is indicated in terms of unmistakable plainness.
'He who knows Brahman and becomes Brahman;' 'he who knows Brahman
becomes all this;' 'as the flowing rivers disappear in the sea
losing their name and form, thus a wise man goes to the divine
person.' And if we look to the whole, to the prevailing spirit of
the Upanishads, we may call the doctrine embodied in passages of
the latter nature the doctrine of the Upanishads. It is, moreover,
supported by the frequently and clearly stated theory of the
individual souls being merged in Brahman in the state of deep
dreamless sleep.</p>
<p>It is much more difficult to indicate the precise teaching of
the Upanishads concerning the original relation of the individual
soul to the highest Self, although there can be no doubt that it
has to be viewed as proceeding from the latter, and somehow forming
a part of it. Negatively we are entitled to say that the doctrine,
according to which the soul is merely brahma bhr&acirc;ntam or
brahma mayopadhikam, is in no way countenanced by the majority of
the passages bearing on the question. If the emission of the
elements, described in the Ch&acirc;ndogya and referred to above,
is a real process&mdash;of which we saw no reason to
doubt&mdash;the j&icirc;va &acirc;tman with which the highest Self
enters into the emitted elements is equally real, a true part or
emanation of Brahman itself.</p>
<p>After having in this way shortly reviewed the chief elements of
Ved&acirc;ntic doctrine according to the Upanishads, we may briefly
consider <i>S</i>a@nkara's system and mode of
interpretation&mdash;with whose details we had frequent
opportunities of finding fault&mdash;as a whole. It has been said
before that the task of reducing the teaching of the whole of the
Upanishads to a system consistent and free from contradictions is
an intrinsically impossible one. But the task once being given, we
are quite ready to admit that <i>S</i>a@nkara's system is most
probably the best which can be devised. <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="pageintro-123" id="pageintro-123"></a>{Intro
123}</span> While unable to allow that the Upanishads recognise a
lower and higher knowledge of Brahman, in fact the distinction of a
lower and higher Brahman, we yet acknowledge that the adoption of
that distinction furnishes the interpreter with an instrument of
extraordinary power for reducing to an orderly whole the
heterogeneous material presented by the old theosophic treatises.
This becomes very manifest as soon as we compare <i>S</i>a@nkara's
system with that of R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja. The latter recognises
only one Brahman which is, as we should say, a personal God, and he
therefore lays stress on all those passages of the Upanishads which
ascribe to Brahman the attributes of a personal God, such as
omniscience and omnipotence. Those passages, on the other hand,
whose decided tendency it is to represent Brahman as transcending
all qualities, as one undifferenced mass of impersonal
intelligence, R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja is unable to accept frankly and
fairly, and has to misinterpret them more or less to make them fall
in with his system. The same remark holds good with regard to those
texts which represent the individual soul as finally identifying
itself with Brahman; R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja cannot allow a complete
identification but merely an assimilation carried as far as
possible. <i>S</i>a@nkara, on the other hand, by skilfully ringing
the changes on a higher and a lower doctrine, somehow manages to
find room for whatever the Upanishads have to say. Where the text
speaks of Brahman as transcending all attributes, the highest
doctrine is set forth. Where Brahman is called the All-knowing
ruler of the world, the author means to propound the lower
knowledge of the Lord only. And where the legends about the primary
being and its way of creating the world become somewhat crude and
gross, Hira<i>n</i>yagarbha and Vir&acirc;j are summoned forth and
charged with the responsibility. Of Vir&acirc;j Mr. Gough remarks
(p. 55) that in him a place is provided by the poets of the
Upanishads for the purusha of the ancient <i>ri</i>shis, the divine
being out of whom the visible and tangible world proceeded. This is
quite true if only we substitute for the 'poets of the Upanishads'
the framers of the orthodox Ved&acirc;nta system&mdash;for the
Upanishads give no indication whatever <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="pageintro-124" id="pageintro-124"></a>{Intro
124}</span> that by their purusha they understand not the simple
old purusha but the Vir&acirc;j occupying a definite position in a
highly elaborate system;&mdash;but the mere phrase, 'providing a
place' intimates with sufficient clearness the nature of the work
in which systematisers of the Ved&acirc;ntic doctrine are
engaged.</p>
<p><i>S</i>a@nkara's method thus enables him in a certain way to do
justice to different stages of historical development, to recognise
clearly existing differences which other systematisers are intent
on obliterating. And there has yet to be made a further and even
more important admission in favour of his system. It is not only
more pliable, more capable of amalgamating heterogeneous material
than other systems, but its fundamental doctrines are manifestly in
greater harmony with the essential teaching of the Upanishads than
those of other Ved&acirc;ntic systems. Above we were unable to
allow that the distinction made by <i>S</i>a@nkara between Brahman
and &Icirc;<i>s</i>vara is known to the Upanishads; but we must now
admit that if, for the purpose of determining the nature of the
highest being, a choice has to be made between those texts which
represent Brahman as nirgu<i>n</i>a, and those which ascribe to it
personal attributes, <i>S</i>a@nkara is right in giving preference
to texts of the former kind. The Brahman of the old Upanishads,
from which the souls spring to enjoy individual consciousness in
their waking state, and into which they sink back temporarily in
the state of deep dreamless sleep and permanently in death, is
certainly not represented adequately by the strictly personal
&Icirc;<i>s</i>vara of R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja, who rules the world in
wisdom and mercy. The older Upanishads, at any rate, lay very
little stress upon personal attributes of their highest being, and
hence <i>S</i>a@nkara is right in so far as he assigns to his
hypostatised personal &Icirc;<i>s</i>vara<a id="footnotetag29"
name="footnotetag29"></a><a href="#footnote29"><sup>29</sup></a> a
lower place than to his absolute Brahman. That he also faithfully
represents the prevailing spirit of the Upanishads in his theory of
the ultimate fate <span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-125" id=
"pageintro-125"></a>{Intro 125}</span> of the soul, we have already
remarked above. And although the M&acirc;y&acirc; doctrine cannot,
in my opinion, be said to form part of the teaching of the
Upanishads, it cannot yet be asserted to contradict it openly,
because the very point which it is meant to elucidate, viz. the
mode in which the physical universe and the multiplicity of
individual souls originate, is left by the Upanishads very much in
the dark. The later growth of the M&acirc;y&acirc; doctrine on the
basis of the Upanishads is therefore quite intelligible, and I
fully agree with Mr. Gough when he says regarding it that there has
been no addition to the system from without but only a development
from within, no graft but only growth. The lines of thought which
finally led to the elaboration of the full-blown M&acirc;y&acirc;
theory may be traced with considerable certainty. In the first
place, deepening speculation on Brahman tended to the notion of
advaita being taken in a more and more strict sense, as implying
not only the exclusion of any second principle external to Brahman,
but also the absence of any elements of duality or plurality in the
nature of the one universal being itself; a tendency agreeing with
the spirit of a certain set of texts from the Upanishads. And as
the fact of the appearance of a manifold world cannot be denied,
the only way open to thoroughly consistent speculation was to deny
at any rate its reality, and to call it a mere illusion due to an
unreal principle, with which Brahman is indeed associated, but
which is unable to break the unity of Brahman's nature just on
account of its own unreality. And, in the second place, a more
thorough following out of the conception that the union with
Brahman is to be reached through true knowledge only, not
unnaturally led to the conclusion that what separates us in our
unenlightened state from Brahman is such as to allow itself to be
completely sublated by an act of knowledge; is, in other words,
nothing else but an erroneous notion, an illusion.&mdash;A further
circumstance which may not impossibly have co-operated to further
the development of the theory of the world's unreality will be
referred to later on.<a id="footnotetag30" name=
"footnotetag30"></a><a href="#footnote30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-126" id=
"pageintro-126"></a>{Intro 126}</span>
<p>We have above been obliged to leave it an open question what
kind of Ved&acirc;nta is represented by the
Ved&acirc;nta-s&ucirc;tras, although reason was shown for the
supposition that in some important points their teaching is more
closely related to the system of R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja than to that
of <i>S</i>a@nkara. If so, the philosophy of <i>S</i>a@nkara would
on the whole stand nearer to the teaching of the Upanishads than
the S&ucirc;tras of B&acirc;dar&acirc;ya<i>n</i>a. This would
indeed be a somewhat unexpected conclusion&mdash;for, judging a
priori, we should be more inclined to assume a direct propagation
of the true doctrine of the Upanishads through
B&acirc;dar&acirc;ya<i>n</i>a to <i>S</i>a@nkara&mdash;but a priori
considerations have of course no weight against positive evidence
to the contrary. There are, moreover, other facts in the history of
Indian philosophy and theology which help us better to appreciate
the possibility of B&acirc;dar&acirc;ya<i>n</i>a's S&ucirc;tras
already setting forth a doctrine that lays greater stress on the
personal character of the highest being than is in agreement with
the prevailing tendency of the Upanishads. That the pure doctrine
of those ancient Brahminical treatises underwent at a rather early
period amalgamations with beliefs which most probably had sprung up
in altogether different&mdash;priestly or
non-priestly&mdash;communities is a well-known circumstance; it
suffices for our purposes to refer to the most eminent of the early
literary monuments in which an amalgamation of the kind mentioned
is observable, viz. the Bhagavadg&icirc;t&acirc;. The doctrine of
the Bhagavadg&icirc;t&acirc; represents a fusion of the Brahman
theory of the Upanishads with the belief in a personal highest
being&mdash;K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>a or Vish<i>n</i>u&mdash;which in
many respects approximates very closely to the system of the
Bh&acirc;gavatas; the attempts of a certain set of Indian
commentators to explain it as setting forth pure Ved&acirc;nta,
i.e. the pure doctrine of the Upanishads, may simply be set aside.
But this same Bhagavadg&icirc;t&acirc; is quoted in
B&acirc;dar&acirc;ya<i>n</i>a's S&ucirc;tras (at least according to
the unanimous explanations of the most eminent scholiasts of
different schools) as inferior to <i>S</i>ruti only in authority.
The S&ucirc;tras, <span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-127" id=
"pageintro-127"></a>{Intro 127}</span> moreover, refer in different
places to certain Ved&acirc;ntic portions of the
Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata, especially the twelfth book, several of
which represent forms of Ved&acirc;nta distinctly differing from
<i>S</i>a@nkara's teaching, and closely related to the system of
the Bh&acirc;gavatas.</p>
<p>Facts of this nature&mdash;from entering into the details of
which we are prevented by want of space&mdash;tend to mitigate the
prim&acirc; facie strangeness of the assumption that the
Ved&acirc;nta-s&ucirc;tras, which occupy an intermediate position
between the Upanishads and <i>S</i>a@nkara, should yet diverge in
their teaching from both. The Ved&acirc;nta of
Gau<i>d</i>ap&acirc;da and <i>S</i>a@nkara would in that case mark
a strictly orthodox reaction against all combinations of non-Vedic
elements of belief and doctrine with the teaching of the
Upanishads. But although this form of doctrine has ever since
<i>S</i>a@nkara's time been the one most generally accepted by
Brahminic students of philosophy, it has never had any
wide-reaching influence on the masses of India. It is too little in
sympathy with the wants of the human heart, which, after all, are
not so very different in India from what they are elsewhere.
Comparatively few, even in India, are those who rejoice in the idea
of a universal non-personal essence in which their own
individuality is to be merged and lost for ever, who think it sweet
'to be wrecked on the ocean of the Infinite.'<a id="footnotetag31"
name="footnotetag31"></a><a href="#footnote31"><sup>31</sup></a>
The only forms of Ved&acirc;ntic philosophy which are&mdash;and can
at any time have been&mdash;really popular, are those in which the
Brahman of the Upanishads has somehow transformed itself into a
being, between which and the devotee there can exist a personal
relation, love and faith on the part of man, justice tempered by
mercy on the part of the divinity. The only religious books of
widespread influence are such as the R&acirc;m&acirc;yan of
Tulsid&acirc;s, which lay no stress on the distinction between an
absolute Brahman inaccessible to all human wants and sympathies,
and a shadowy Lord whose very conception depends on the illusory
principle of M&acirc;y&acirc;, but love to dwell on the delights of
devotion <span class="pagenum"><a name="pageintro-128" id=
"pageintro-128"></a>{Intro 128}</span> to one all-wise and merciful
ruler, who is able and willing to lend a gracious ear to the
supplication of the worshipper.</p>
<hr />
<p>The present translation of the Ved&acirc;nta-s&ucirc;tras does
not aim at rendering that sense which their author may have aimed
at conveying, but strictly follows <i>S</i>a@nkara's
interpretation. The question as to how far the latter agrees with
the views held by B&acirc;dar&acirc;ya<i>n</i>a has been discussed
above, with the result that for the present it must, on the whole,
be left an open one. In any case it would not be feasible to
combine a translation of <i>S</i>a@nkara's commentary with an
independent version of the S&ucirc;tras which it explains. Similar
considerations have determined the method followed in rendering the
passages of the Upanishads referred to in the S&ucirc;tras and
discussed at length by <i>S</i>a@nkara. There also the views of the
commentator have to be followed closely; otherwise much of the
comment would appear devoid of meaning. Hence, while of course
following on the whole the critical translation published by
Professor Max M&uuml;ller in the earlier volumes of this Series, I
had, in a not inconsiderable number of cases, to modify it so as to
render intelligible <i>S</i>a@nkara's explanations and reasonings.
I hope to find space in the introduction to the second volume of
this translation for making some general remarks on the method to
be followed in translating the Upanishads.</p>
<p>I regret that want of space has prevented me from extracting
fuller notes from later scholiasts. The notes given are based, most
of them, on the <i>t</i>&icirc;k&acirc;s composed by
&Acirc;nandagiri and Govind&acirc;nanda (the former of which is
unpublished as yet, so far as I know), and on the
Bh&acirc;mat&icirc;.</p>
<p>My best thanks are due to Pa<i>nd</i>its R&acirc;ma Mi<i>s</i>ra
<i>S</i>&acirc;strin and Ga@ng&acirc;dhara <i>S</i>&acirc;strin of
the Benares Sanskrit College, whom I have consulted on several
difficult passages. Greater still are my obligations to
Pa<i>nd</i>it Ke<i>s</i>ava <i>S</i>&acirc;strin, of the same
institution, who most kindly undertook to read a proof of the whole
of the present volume, and whose advice has enabled me to render my
version of more than one passage more definite or correct.</p>

<center>REVERENCE TO THE AUGUST V&Acirc;SUDEVA!</center>
<p>It is a matter not requiring any proof that the object and the
subject<a id="footnotetag32" name="footnotetag32"></a><a href=
"#footnote32"><sup>32</sup></a> whose respective spheres are the
notion of the 'Thou' (the Non-Ego<a id="footnotetag33" name=
"footnotetag33"></a><a href="#footnote33"><sup>33</sup></a>) and
the 'Ego,' and which are opposed to each other as much as darkness
and light are, cannot be identified. All the less can their
respective attributes be identified. Hence it follows that it is
wrong to superimpose<a id="footnotetag34" name=
"footnotetag34"></a><a href="#footnote34"><sup>34</sup></a> upon
the subject&mdash;whose Self is intelligence, and which has for its
sphere the notion of the Ego&mdash;the object whose sphere is the
notion of the Non-Ego, and the attributes of the object, and
<i>vice vers&acirc;</i> to superimpose the subject and the
attributes of the subject on the object. In spite of this it is on
the part of man a natural<a id="footnotetag35" name=
"footnotetag35"></a><a href="#footnote35"><sup>35</sup></a>
procedure&mdash;which <span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id=
"page4"></a>{4}</span> which has its cause in wrong
knowledge&mdash;not to distinguish the two entities (object and
subject) and their respective attributes, although they are
absolutely distinct, but to superimpose upon each the
characteristic nature and the attributes of the other, and thus,
coupling the Real and the Unreal<a id="footnotetag36" name=
"footnotetag36"></a><a href="#footnote36"><sup>36</sup></a>, to
make use of expressions such as 'That am I,' 'That is mine.<a id=
"footnotetag37" name="footnotetag37"></a><a href=
"#footnote37"><sup>37</sup></a>'&mdash;But what have we to
understand by the term 'superimposition?'&mdash;The apparent
presentation, in the form of remembrance, to consciousness of
something previously observed, in some other thing.<a id=
"footnotetag38" name="footnotetag38"></a><a href=
"#footnote38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>Some indeed define the term 'superimposition' as the
superimposition of the attributes of one thing on another
thing.<a id="footnotetag39" name="footnotetag39"></a><a href=
"#footnote39"><sup>39</sup></a> Others, again, define
superimposition as the error <span class="pagenum"><a name="page5"
id="page5"></a>{5}</span> founded on the non-apprehension of the
difference of that which is superimposed from that on which it is
superimposed.<a id="footnotetag40" name=
"footnotetag40"></a><a href="#footnote40"><sup>40</sup></a>
Others<a id="footnotetag41" name="footnotetag41"></a><a href=
"#footnote41"><sup>41</sup></a>, again, define it as the fictitious
assumption of attributes contrary to the nature of that thing on
which something else is superimposed. But all these definitions
agree in so far as they represent superimposition as the apparent
presentation of the attributes of one thing in another thing. And
therewith agrees also the popular view which is exemplified by
expressions such as the following: 'Mother-of-pearl appears like
silver,' 'The moon although one only appears as if she were
double.' But how is it possible that on the interior Self which
itself is not an object there should be superimposed objects and
their attributes? For every one superimposes an object only on such
other objects as are placed before him (i.e. in contact with his
sense-organs), and you have said before that the interior Self
which is entirely disconnected from the idea of the Thou (the
Non-Ego) is never an object. It is not, we reply, non-object in the
absolute sense. For it is the object of the notion of the Ego<a id=
"footnotetag42" name="footnotetag42"></a><a href=
"#footnote42"><sup>42</sup></a>, and the interior Self is well
known to exist on account of its immediate (intuitive)
presentation.<a id="footnotetag43" name=
"footnotetag43"></a><a href="#footnote43"><sup>43</sup></a> Nor is
it an exceptionless rule that objects <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>{6}</span> can be
superimposed only on such other objects as are before us, i.e. in
contact with our sense-organs; for non-discerning men superimpose
on the ether, which is not the object of sensuous perception,
dark-blue colour.</p>
<p>Hence it follows that the assumption of the Non-Self being
superimposed on the interior Self is not unreasonable.</p>
<p>This superimposition thus defined, learned men consider to be
Nescience (avidy&acirc;), and the ascertainment of the true nature
of that which is (the Self) by means of the discrimination of that
(which is superimposed on the Self), they call knowledge
(vidy&acirc;). There being such knowledge (neither the Self nor the
Non-Self) are affected in the least by any blemish or (good)
quality produced by their mutual superimposition<a id=
"footnotetag44" name="footnotetag44"></a><a href=
"#footnote44"><sup>44</sup></a>. The mutual superimposition of the
Self and the Non-Self, which is termed Nescience, is the
presupposition on which there base all the practical
distinctions&mdash;those made in ordinary life as well as those
laid down by the Veda&mdash;between means of knowledge, objects of
knowledge (and knowing persons), and all scriptural texts, whether
they are concerned with injunctions and prohibitions (of
meritorious and non-meritorious actions), or with final
release<a id="footnotetag45" name="footnotetag45"></a><a href=
"#footnote45"><sup>45</sup></a>.&mdash;But how can the means of
right <span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id=
"page7"></a>{7}</span> knowledge such as perception, inference,
&amp;c., and scriptural texts have for their object that which is
dependent on Nescience<a id="footnotetag46" name=
"footnotetag46"></a><a href=
"#footnote46"><sup>46</sup></a>?&mdash;Because, we reply, the means
of right knowledge cannot operate unless there be a knowing
personality, and because the existence of the latter depends on the
erroneous notion that the body, the senses, and so on, are
identical with, or belong to, the Self of the knowing person. For
without the employment of the senses, perception and the other
means of right knowledge cannot operate. And without a basis (i.e.
the body<a id="footnotetag47" name="footnotetag47"></a><a href=
"#footnote47"><sup>47</sup></a>) the senses cannot act. Nor does
anybody act by means of a body on which the nature of the Self is
not superimposed<a id="footnotetag48" name=
"footnotetag48"></a><a href="#footnote48"><sup>48</sup></a>. Nor
can, in the absence of all that<a id="footnotetag49" name=
"footnotetag49"></a><a href="#footnote49"><sup>49</sup></a>, the
Self which, in its own nature is free from all contact, become a
knowing agent. And if there is no knowing agent, the means of right
knowledge cannot operate (as said above). Hence perception and the
other means of right knowledge, and the Vedic texts have for their
object that which is dependent on Nescience. (That human
cognitional activity has for its presupposition the superimposition
described above), follows also from the non-difference in that
respect of men from animals. Animals, when sounds or other sensible
qualities affect their sense of hearing or other senses, recede or
advance according as the idea derived from the sensation is a
comforting or disquieting one. A cow, for instance, when she sees a
man approaching with a raised stick in his hand, thinks that he
wants to beat her, and therefore moves away; while she walks up to
a man who advances with some fresh grass in his hand. Thus men
also&mdash;who possess a higher intelligence&mdash;run away when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>{8}</span>
they see strong fierce-looking fellows drawing near with shouts and
brandishing swords; while they confidently approach persons of
contrary appearance and behaviour. We thus see that men and animals
follow the same course of procedure with reference to the means and
objects of knowledge. Now it is well known that the procedure of
animals bases on the non-distinction (of Self and Non-Self); we
therefore conclude that, as they present the same appearances, men
also&mdash;although distinguished by superior
intelligence&mdash;proceed with regard to perception and so on, in
the same way as animals do; as long, that is to say, as the mutual
superimposition of Self and Non-Self lasts. With reference again to
that kind of activity which is founded on the Veda (sacrifices and
the like), it is true indeed that the reflecting man who is
qualified to enter on it, does so not without knowing that the Self
has a relation to another world; yet that qualification does not
depend on the knowledge, derivable from the Ved&acirc;nta-texts, of
the true nature of the Self as free from all wants, raised above
the distinctions of the Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a and
Kshattriya-classes and so on, transcending transmigratory
existence. For such knowledge is useless and even contradictory to
the claim (on the part of sacrificers, &amp;c. to perform certain
actions and enjoy their fruits). And before such knowledge of the
Self has arisen, the Vedic texts continue in their operation, to
have for their object that which is dependent on Nescience. For
such texts as the following, 'A Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a is to
sacrifice,' are operative only on the supposition that on the Self
are superimposed particular conditions such as caste, stage of
life, age, outward circumstances, and so on. That by
superimposition we have to understand the notion of something in
some other thing we have already explained. (The superimposition of
the Non-Self will be understood more definitely from the following
examples.) Extra-personal attributes are superimposed on the Self,
if a man considers himself sound and entire, or the contrary, as
long as his wife, children, and so on are sound and entire or not.
Attributes of the body are superimposed on the Self, if a man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>{9}</span>
thinks of himself (his Self) as stout, lean, fair, as standing,
walking, or jumping. Attributes of the sense-organs, if he thinks
'I am mute, or deaf, or one-eyed, or blind.' Attributes of the
internal organ when he considers himself subject to desire,
intention, doubt, determination, and so on. Thus the producer of
the notion of the Ego (i.e. the internal organ) is superimposed on
the interior Self, which, in reality, is the witness of all the
modifications of the internal organ, and vice vers&aacute; the
interior Self, which is the witness of everything, is superimposed
on the internal organ, the senses, and so on. In this way there
goes on this natural beginning&mdash;and endless superimposition,
which appears in the form of wrong conception, is the cause of
individual souls appearing as agents and enjoyers (of the results
of their actions), and is observed by every one.</p>
<p>With a view to freeing one's self from that wrong notion which
is the cause of all evil and attaining thereby the knowledge of the
absolute unity of the Self the study of the Ved&acirc;nta-texts is
begun. That all the Ved&acirc;nta-texts have the mentioned purport
we shall show in this so-called
<i>S</i>&acirc;riraka-m&icirc;m&acirc;<i>m</i>s&acirc;.<a id=
"footnotetag50" name="footnotetag50"></a><a href=
"#footnote50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<p>Of this Ved&acirc;nta-m&icirc;m&acirc;<i>m</i>s&acirc; about to
be explained by us the first S&ucirc;tra is as follows.</p>
<p>1. Then therefore the enquiry into Brahman.</p>
<p>The word 'then' is here to be taken as denoting immediate
consecution; not as indicating the introduction of a new subject to
be entered upon; for the enquiry into Brahman (more literally, the
desire of knowing Brahman) is not of that nature<a id=
"footnotetag51" name="footnotetag51"></a><a href=
"#footnote51"><sup>51</sup></a>. Nor has the word 'then' the sense
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>{10}</span>
of auspiciousness (or blessing); for a word of that meaning could
not be properly construed as a part of the sentence. The word
'then' rather acts as an auspicious term by being pronounced and
heard merely, while it denotes at the same time something else,
viz. immediate consecution as said above. That the latter is its
meaning follows moreover from the circumstance that the relation in
which the result stands to the previous topic (viewed as the cause
of the result) is non-separate from the relation of immediate
consecution.<a id="footnotetag52" name="footnotetag52"></a><a href=
"#footnote52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<p>If, then, the word 'then' intimates immediate consecution it
must be explained on what antecedent the enquiry into Brahman
specially depends; just as the enquiry into active religious duty
(which forms the subject of the P&ucirc;rv&acirc;
M&icirc;m&acirc;<i>m</i>s&acirc;) specially depends on the
antecedent reading of the Veda. The reading of the Veda indeed is
the common antecedent (for those who wish to enter on an enquiry
into religious duty as well as for those desirous of knowing
Brahman). The special question with regard to the enquiry into
Brahman is whether it presupposes as its antecedent the
understanding of the acts of religious duty (which is acquired by
means of the P&ucirc;rv&acirc; M&icirc;m&acirc;<i>m</i>s&acirc;).
To this question we reply in the negative, because for a man who
has read the Ved&acirc;nta-parts of the Veda it is possible to
enter on the enquiry into Brahman even before engaging in the
enquiry into religious duty. Nor is it the purport of the word
'then' to indicate order of succession; a purport which it serves
in other passages, as, for instance, in the one enjoining the
cutting off of pieces from the heart and other <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>{11}</span> parts of the
sacrificial animal.<a id="footnotetag53" name=
"footnotetag53"></a><a href="#footnote53"><sup>53</sup></a> (For
the intimation of order of succession could be intended only if the
agent in both cases were the same; but this is not the case),
because there is no proof for assuming the enquiry into religious
duty and the enquiry into Brahman to stand in the relation of
principal and subordinate matter or the relation of qualification
(for a certain act) on the part of the person qualified<a id=
"footnotetag54" name="footnotetag54"></a><a href=
"#footnote54"><sup>54</sup></a>; and because the result as well as
the object of the enquiry differs in the two cases. The knowledge
of active religious duty has for its fruit transitory felicity, and
that again depends on the performance of religious acts. The
enquiry into Brahman, on the other hand, has for its fruit eternal
bliss, and does not depend on the performance of any acts. Acts of
religious duty do not yet exist at the time when they are enquired
into, but are something to be accomplished (in the future); for
they depend on the activity of man. In the
Brahma-m&icirc;m&aacute;<i>m</i>s&acirc;, on the other hand, the
object of enquiry, i.e. Brahman, is something already accomplished
(existent),&mdash;for it is eternal,&mdash;and does not depend on
human energy. The two enquiries differ moreover in so far as the
operation of their respective fundamental texts is concerned. For
the fundamental texts on which active religious duty depends convey
information to man in so far only as they enjoin on him their own
particular subjects (sacrifices, &amp;c.); while the fundamental
texts about Brahman merely instruct man, without laying on him the
injunction of being instructed, instruction being their immediate
result. The case is analogous to that of the information regarding
objects of sense which ensues as soon as the objects are
approximated to the senses. It therefore is requisite that
something should be <span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id=
"page12"></a>{12}</span> stated subsequent to which the enquiry
into Brahman is proposed.&mdash;Well, then, we maintain that the
antecedent conditions are the discrimination of what is eternal and
what is non-eternal; the renunciation of all desire to enjoy the
fruit (of one's actions) both here and hereafter; the acquirement
of tranquillity, self-restraint, and the other means<a id=
"footnotetag55" name="footnotetag55"></a><a href=
"#footnote55"><sup>55</sup></a>, and the desire of final release.
If these conditions exist, a man may, either before entering on an
enquiry into active religious duty or after that, engage in the
enquiry into Brahman and come to know it; but not otherwise. The
word 'then' therefore intimates that the enquiry into Brahman is
subsequent to the acquisition of the above-mentioned (spiritual)
means.</p>
<p>The word 'therefore' intimates a reason. Because the Veda, while
declaring that the fruit of the agnihotra and similar performances
which are means of happiness is non-eternal (as, for instance. Ch.
Up. VIII, 1, 6, 'As here on earth whatever has been acquired by
action perishes so perishes in the next world whatever is acquired
by acts of religious duty'), teaches at the same time that the
highest aim of man is realised by the knowledge of Brahman (as, for
instance, Taitt. Up. II, 1, 'He who knows Brahman attains the
highest'); therefore the enquiry into Brahman is to be undertaken
subsequently to the acquirement of the mentioned means.</p>
<p>By Brahman is to be understood that the definition of which will
be given in the next S&ucirc;tra (I, 1, 2); it is therefore not to
be supposed that the word Brahman may here denote something else,
as, for instance, the brahminical caste. In the S&ucirc;tra the
genitive case ('of Brahman;' the literal translation of the
S&ucirc;tra being 'then therefore the desire of knowledge of
Brahman') denotes the object, not something generally supplementary
(<i>s</i>esha<a id="footnotetag56" name=
"footnotetag56"></a><a href="#footnote56"><sup>56</sup></a>); for
the desire of knowledge <span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id=
"page13"></a>{13}</span> demands an object of desire and no other
such object is stated.&mdash;But why should not the genitive case
be taken as expressing the general complementary relation (to
express which is its proper office)? Even in that case it might
constitute the object of the desire of knowledge, since the general
relation may base itself on the more particular one.&mdash;This
assumption, we reply, would mean that we refuse to take Brahman as
the direct object, and then again indirectly introduce it as the
object; an altogether needless procedure.&mdash;Not needless; for
if we explain the words of the S&ucirc;tra to mean 'the desire of
knowledge connected with Brahman' we thereby virtually promise that
also all the heads of discussion which bear on Brahman will be
treated.&mdash;This reason also, we reply, is not strong enough to
uphold your interpretation. For the statement of some principal
matter already implies all the secondary matters connected
therewith. Hence if Brahman, the most eminent of all objects of
knowledge, is mentioned, this implies already all those objects of
enquiry which the enquiry into Brahman presupposes, and those
objects need therefore not be mentioned, especially in the
S&ucirc;tra. Analogously the sentence 'there the king is going'
implicitly means that the king together with his retinue is going
there. Our interpretation (according to which the S&ucirc;tra
represents Brahman as the direct object of knowledge) moreover
agrees with Scripture, which directly represents Brahman as the
object of the desire of knowledge; compare, for instance, the
passage, 'That from whence these beings are born, &amp;c., desire
to know that. That is Brahman' (Taitt. Up. III, 1). With passages
of this kind the S&ucirc;tra only agrees if the genitive case is
taken to denote the object. Hence we do take it in that sense. The
object of the desire is the knowledge of Brahman up to its complete
comprehension, desires having reference to results<a id=
"footnotetag57" name="footnotetag57"></a><a href=
"#footnote57"><sup>57</sup></a>. Knowledge thus constitutes the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>{14}</span>
means by which the complete comprehension of Brahman is desired to
be obtained. For the complete comprehension of Brahman is the
highest end of man, since it destroys the root of all evil such as
Nescience, the seed of the entire Sa<i>m</i>s&acirc;ra. Hence the
desire of knowing Brahman is to be entertained.</p>
<p>But, it may be asked, is Brahman known or not known (previously
to the enquiry into its nature)? If it is known we need not enter
on an enquiry concerning it; if it is not known we can not enter on
such an enquiry.</p>
<p>We reply that Brahman is known. Brahman, which is all-knowing
and endowed with all powers, whose essential nature is eternal
purity, intelligence, and freedom, exists. For if we consider the
derivation of the word 'Brahman,' from the root b<i>ri</i>h, 'to be
great,' we at once understand that eternal purity, and so on,
belong to Brahman<a id="footnotetag58" name=
"footnotetag58"></a><a href="#footnote58"><sup>58</sup></a>.
Moreover the existence of Brahman is known on the ground of its
being the Self of every one. For every one is conscious of the
existence of (his) Self, and never thinks 'I am not.' If the
existence of the Self were not known, every one would think 'I am
not.' And this Self (of whose existence all are conscious) is
Brahman. But if Brahman is generally known as the Self, there is no
room for an enquiry into it! Not so, we reply; for there is a
conflict of opinions as to its special nature. Unlearned people and
the Lok&acirc;yatikas are of opinion that the mere body endowed
with the quality of intelligence is the Self; others that the
organs endowed with intelligence are the Self; others maintain that
the internal organ is the Self; others, again, that the Self is a
mere momentary idea; others, again, that it is the Void. Others,
again (to proceed to the opinion of such as acknowledge the
authority of the Veda), maintain that there is a transmigrating
being different from the body, and so on, which is both agent and
enjoyer (of the fruits of action); others teach <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>{15}</span> that that
being is enjoying only, not acting; others believe that in addition
to the individual souls, there is an all-knowing, all-powerful
Lord<a id="footnotetag59" name="footnotetag59"></a><a href=
"#footnote59"><sup>59</sup></a>. Others, finally, (i.e. the
Ved&acirc;ntins) maintain that the Lord is the Self of the enjoyer
(i.e. of the individual soul whose individual existence is apparent
only, the product of Nescience).</p>
<p>Thus there are many various opinions, basing part of them on
sound arguments and scriptural texts, part of them on fallacious
arguments and scriptural texts misunderstood<a id="footnotetag60"
name="footnotetag60"></a><a href="#footnote60"><sup>60</sup></a>.
If therefore a man would embrace some one of these opinions without
previous consideration, he would bar himself from the highest
beatitude and incur grievous loss. For this reason the first
S&ucirc;tra proposes, under the designation of an enquiry into
Brahman, a disquisition of the Ved&acirc;nta-texts, to be carried
on with the help of conformable arguments, and having for its aim
the highest beatitude.</p>
<p>So far it has been said that Brahman is to be enquired into. The
question now arises what the characteristics of that Brahman are,
and the reverend author of the S&ucirc;tras therefore propounds the
following aphorism.</p>
<p>2. (Brahman is that) from which the origin, &amp;c. (i.e. the
origin, subsistence, and dissolution) of this (world proceed).</p>
<p>The term, &amp;c. implies subsistence and re-absorption. That
the origin is mentioned first (of the three) depends on the
declaration of Scripture as well as on the natural development of a
substance. Scripture declares the order <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>{16}</span> of
succession of origin, subsistence, and dissolution in the passage,
Taitt. Up. III, 1, 'From whence these beings are born,' &amp;c. And
with regard to the second reason stated, it is known that a
substrate of qualities can subsist and be dissolved only after it
has entered, through origination, on the state of existence. The
words 'of this' denote that substrate of qualities which is
presented to us by perception and the other means of right
knowledge; the genitive case indicates it to be connected with
origin, &amp;c. The words 'from which' denote the cause. The full
sense of the S&ucirc;tra therefore is: That omniscient omnipotent
cause from which proceed the origin, subsistence, and dissolution
of this world&mdash;which world is differentiated by names and
forms, contains many agents and enjoyers, is the abode of the
fruits of actions, these fruits having their definite places,
times, and causes<a id="footnotetag61" name=
"footnotetag61"></a><a href="#footnote61"><sup>61</sup></a>, and
the nature of whose arrangement cannot even be conceived by the
mind,&mdash;that cause, we say, is Brahman. Since the other forms
of existence (such as increase, decline, &amp;c.) are included in
origination, subsistence, and dissolution, only the three latter
are referred to in the S&ucirc;tra. As the six stages of existence
enumerated by Y&acirc;ska<a id="footnotetag62" name=
"footnotetag62"></a><a href="#footnote62"><sup>62</sup></a> are
possible only during the period of the world's subsistence, it
might&mdash;were they referred to in the S&ucirc;tra&mdash;be
suspected that what is meant are not the origin, subsistence, and
dissolution (of the world) as dependent on the first cause. To
preclude this suspicion the S&ucirc;tra is to be taken as
referring, in addition to the world's origination from Brahman,
only to its subsistence in Brahman, and final dissolution into
Brahman.</p>
<p>The origin, &amp;c. of a world possessing the attributes stated
above cannot possibly proceed from anything else but a Lord
possessing the stated qualities; not either from a non-intelligent
pr&acirc;dhana<a id="footnotetag63" name=
"footnotetag63"></a><a href="#footnote63"><sup>63</sup></a>, or
from atoms, or from non-being, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page17" id="page17"></a>{17}</span> or from a being subject to
transmigration<a id="footnotetag64" name=
"footnotetag64"></a><a href="#footnote64"><sup>64</sup></a>; nor,
again, can it proceed from its own nature (i.e. spontaneously,
without a cause), since we observe that (for the production of
effects) special places, times, and causes have invariably to be
employed.</p>
<p>(Some of) those who maintain a Lord to be the cause of the
world<a id="footnotetag65" name="footnotetag65"></a><a href=
"#footnote65"><sup>65</sup></a>, think that the existence of a Lord
different from mere transmigrating beings can be inferred by means
of the argument stated just now (without recourse being had to
Scripture at all).&mdash;But, it might be said, you yourself in the
S&ucirc;tra under discussion have merely brought forward the same
argument!&mdash;By no means, we reply. The S&ucirc;tras (i.e.
literally 'the strings') have merely the purpose of stringing
together the flowers of the Ved&acirc;nta-passages. In reality the
Ved&acirc;nta-passages referred to by the S&ucirc;tras are
discussed here. For the comprehension of Brahman is effected by the
ascertainment, consequent on discussion, of the sense of the
Ved&acirc;nta-texts, not either by inference or by the other means
of right knowledge. While, however, the Ved&acirc;nta-passages
primarily declare the cause of the origin, &amp;c., of the world,
inference also, being an instrument of right knowledge in so far as
it does not contradict the Ved&acirc;nta-texts, is not to be
excluded as a means of confirming the meaning ascertained.
Scripture itself, moreover, allows argumentation; for the passages,
B<i>ri</i>. Up. II, 4, 5 ('the Self is to be heard, to be
considered'), and Ch. Up. VI, 14, 2 ('as the man, &amp;c., having
been informed, and being able to judge for himself, would arrive at
Gandh&acirc;ra, in the same way a man who meets with a teacher
obtains knowledge'), declare that human understanding assists
Scripture<a id="footnotetag66" name="footnotetag66"></a><a href=
"#footnote66"><sup>66</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Scriptural text, &amp;c.<a id="footnotetag67" name=
"footnotetag67"></a><a href="#footnote67"><sup>67</sup></a>, are
not, in the enquiry into Brahman, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page18" id="page18"></a>{18}</span> the only means of knowledge,
as they are in the enquiry into active duty (i.e. in the
P&ucirc;rva Mim&acirc;<i>m</i>s&acirc;), but scriptural texts on
the one hand, and intuition<a id="footnotetag68" name=
"footnotetag68"></a><a href="#footnote68"><sup>68</sup></a>,
&amp;c., on the other hand, are to be had recourse to according to
the occasion: firstly, because intuition is the final result of the
enquiry into Brahman; secondly, because the object of the enquiry
is an existing (accomplished) substance. If the object of the
knowledge of Brahman were something to be accomplished, there would
be no reference to intuition, and text, &amp;c., would be the only
means of knowledge. The origination of something to be accomplished
depends, moreover, on man since any action either of ordinary life,
or dependent on the Veda may either be done or not be done, or be
done in a different way. A man, for instance, may move on either by
means of a horse, or by means of his feet, or by some other means,
or not at all. And again (to quote examples of actions dependent on
the Veda), we meet in Scripture with sentences such as the
following: 'At the atir&acirc;tra he takes the sho<i>d</i>asin
cup,' and 'at the atir&acirc;tra he does not take the
sho<i>d</i>asin cup;' or, 'he makes the oblation after the sun has
risen,' and, 'he makes the oblation when the sun has not yet
risen.' Just as in the quoted instances, injunctions and
prohibitions, allowances of optional procedure, general rules and
exceptions have their place, so they would have their place with
regard to Brahman also (if the latter were a thing to be
accomplished). But the fact is that no option is possible as to
whether a substance is to be thus or thus, is to be or not to be.
All option depends on the notions of man; but the knowledge of the
real nature of a thing does not depend on the notions of man, but
only on the thing itself. For to think with regard to a post, 'this
is a post or a man, or something else,' is not knowledge of truth;
the two ideas, 'it is a man or something else,' being false, and
only the third idea, 'it <span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id=
"page19"></a>{19}</span> is a post,' which depends on the thing
itself, falling under the head of true knowledge. Thus true
knowledge of all existing things depends on the things themselves,
and hence the knowledge of Brahman also depends altogether on the
thing, i.e. Brahman itself.&mdash;But, it might be said, as Brahman
is an existing substance, it will be the object of the other means
of right knowledge also, and from this it follows that a discussion
of the Ved&acirc;nta-texts is purposeless.&mdash;This we deny; for
as Brahman is not an object of the senses, it has no connection
with those other means of knowledge. For the senses have, according
to their nature, only external things for their objects, not
Brahman. If Brahman were an object of the senses, we might perceive
that the world is connected with Brahman as its effect; but as the
effect only (i.e. the world) is perceived, it is impossible to
decide (through perception) whether it is connected with Brahman or
something else. Therefore the S&ucirc;tra under discussion is not
meant to propound inference (as the means of knowing Brahman), but
rather to set forth a Ved&acirc;nta-text.&mdash;Which, then, is the
Ved&acirc;nta-text which the S&ucirc;tra points at as having to be
considered with reference to the characteristics of
Brahman?&mdash;It is the passage Taitt. Up. III, 1, 'Bh<i>ri</i>gu
V&acirc;ru<i>n</i>i went to his father Varu<i>n</i>a, saying, Sir,
teach me Brahman,' &amp;c., up to 'That from whence these beings
are born, that by which, when born, they live, that into which they
enter at their death, try to know that. That is Brahman.' The
sentence finally determining the sense of this passage is found
III, 6: 'From bliss these beings are born; by bliss, when born,
they live; into bliss they enter at their death.' Other passages
also are to be adduced which declare the cause to be the almighty
Being, whose essential nature is eternal purity, intelligence, and
freedom.</p>
<p>That Brahman is omniscient we have been made to infer from it
being shown that it is the cause of the world. To confirm this
conclusion, the S&ucirc;trak&acirc;ra continues as follows:</p>
<p>3. (The omniscience of Brahman follows) from its being the
source of Scripture.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>{20}</span>
<p>Brahman is the source, i.e. the cause of the great body of
Scripture, consisting of the <i>Ri</i>g-veda and other branches,
which is supported by various disciplines (such as grammar,
ny&acirc;ya, pur&acirc;<i>n</i>a, &amp;c.); which lamp-like
illuminates all things; which is itself all-knowing as it were. For
the origin of a body of Scripture possessing the quality of
omniscience cannot be sought elsewhere but in omniscience itself.
It is generally understood that the man from whom some special body
of doctrine referring to one province of knowledge only originates,
as, for instance, grammar from P&acirc;<i>n</i>ini possesses a more
extensive knowledge than his work, comprehensive though it be; what
idea, then, shall we have to form of the supreme omniscience and
omnipotence of that great Being, which in sport as it were, easily
as a man sends forth his breath, has produced the vast mass of holy
texts known as the <i>Ri</i>g-veda, &amp;c., the mine of all
knowledge, consisting of manifold branches, the cause of the
distinction of all the different classes and conditions of gods,
animals, and men! See what Scripture says about him, 'The
<i>Ri</i>g-veda, &amp;c., have been breathed forth from that great
Being' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. II, 4, 10).</p>
<p>Or else we may interpret the S&ucirc;tra to mean that Scripture
consisting of the <i>Ri</i>g-veda, &amp;c., as described above, is
the source or cause, i.e. the means of right knowledge through
which we understand the nature of Brahman. So that the sense would
be: through Scripture only as a means of knowledge Brahman is known
to be the cause of the origin, &amp;c., of the world. The special
scriptural passage meant has been quoted under the preceding
S&ucirc;tra 'from which these beings are born,' &amp;c.&mdash;But
as the preceding S&ucirc;tra already has pointed out a text showing
that Scripture is the source of Brahman, of what use then is the
present S&ucirc;tra?&mdash;The words of the preceding S&ucirc;tra,
we reply, did not clearly indicate the scriptural passage, and room
was thus left for the suspicion that the origin, &amp;c., of the
world were adduced merely as determining an inference (independent
of Scripture). To obviate this suspicion the S&ucirc;tra under
discussion has been propounded.</p>
<p>But, again, how can it be said that Scripture is the means of
knowing Brahman? Since it has been declared that Scripture aims at
action (according to the P&ucirc;rva
M&icirc;m&acirc;<i>m</i>s&acirc; <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page21" id="page21"></a>{21}</span> S&ucirc;tra I, 2, 1, 'As the
purport of Scripture is action, those scriptural passages whose
purport is not action are purportless'), the Ved&acirc;nta-passages
whose purport is not action are purportless. Or else if they are to
have some sense, they must either, by manifesting the agent, the
divinity or the fruit of the action, form supplements to the
passages enjoining actions, or serve the purpose of themselves
enjoining a new class of actions, such as devout meditation and the
like. For the Veda cannot possibly aim at conveying information
regarding the nature of accomplished substances, since the latter
are the objects of perception and the other means of proof (which
give sufficient information about them; while it is the recognised
object of the Veda to give information about what is not known from
other sources). And if it did give such information, it would not
be connected with things to be desired or shunned, and thus be of
no use to man. For this very reason Vedic passages, such as 'he
howled, &amp;c.,' which at first sight appear purposeless, are
shown to have a purpose in so far as they glorify certain actions
(cp. P&ucirc;. M&icirc;. S&ucirc;. I, 2, 7, 'Because they stand in
syntactical connection with the injunctions, therefore their
purport is to glorify the injunctions'). In the same way mantras
are shown to stand in a certain relation to actions, in so far as
they notify the actions themselves and the means by which they are
accomplished. So, for instance, the mantra, 'For strength thee (I
cut;' which accompanies the cutting of a branch employed in the
dar<i>s</i>ap&ucirc;r<i>n</i>am&acirc;sa-sacrifice). In short, no
Vedic passage is seen or can be proved to have a meaning but in so
far as it is related to an action. And injunctions which are
defined as having actions for their objects cannot refer to
accomplished existent things. Hence we maintain that the
Ved&acirc;nta-texts are mere supplements to those passages which
enjoin actions; notifying the agents, divinities, and results
connected with those actions. Or else, if this be not admitted, on
the ground of its involving the introduction of a subject-matter
foreign to the Ved&acirc;nta-texts (viz. the subject-matter of the
Karmak&acirc;<i>nd</i>a of the Veda), we must admit (the second of
the two alternatives proposed above viz.) that the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>{22}</span>
Ved&acirc;nta-texts refer to devout meditation
(up&acirc;san&acirc;) and similar actions which are mentioned in
those very (Ved&acirc;nta) texts. The result of all of which is
that Scripture is not the source of Brahman.</p>
<p>To this argumentation the S&ucirc;trak&acirc;ra replies as
follows:</p>
<p>4. But that (Brahman is to be known from Scripture), because it
is connected (with the Ved&acirc;nta-texts) as their purport.</p>
<p>The word 'but' is meant to rebut the p&ucirc;rva-paksha (the
prim&acirc; facie view as urged above). That all-knowing,
all-powerful Brahman, which is the cause of the origin,
subsistence, and dissolution of the world, is known from the
Ved&acirc;nta-part of Scripture. How? Because in all the
Ved&acirc;nta-texts the sentences construe in so far as they have
for their purport, as they intimate that matter (viz. Brahman).
Compare, for instance, 'Being only this was in the beginning, one,
without a second' (Ch. Up. VI, 2, 1); 'In the beginning all this
was Self, one only' (Ait. &Acirc;r. II, 4, 1, 1); 'This is the
Brahman without cause and without effect, without anything inside
or outside; this Self is Brahman perceiving everything'
(B<i>ri</i>. Up. II, 5, 19); 'That immortal Brahman is before' (Mu.
Up. II, 2, 11); and similar passages. If the words contained in
these passages have once been determined to refer to Brahman, and
their purport is understood thereby, it would be improper to assume
them to have a different sense; for that would involve the fault of
abandoning the direct statements of the text in favour of mere
assumptions. Nor can we conclude the purport of these passages to
be the intimation of the nature of agents, divinities, &amp;c.
(connected with acts of religious duty); for there are certain
scriptural passages which preclude all actions, actors, and fruits,
as, for instance, B<i>ri</i>. Up. II, 4, 13, 'Then by what should
he see whom?' (which passage intimates that there is neither an
agent, nor an object of action, nor an instrument.) Nor again can
Brahman, though it is of the nature of an accomplished thing, be
the object of perception and the other means of <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>{23}</span> knowledge;
for the fact of everything having its Self in Brahman cannot be
grasped without the aid of the scriptural passage 'That art thou'
(Ch. Up. VI, 8, 7). Nor can it rightly be objected that instruction
is purportless if not connected with something either to be striven
after or shunned; for from the mere comprehension of Brahman's
Self, which is not something either to be avoided or endeavoured
after, there results cessation of all pain, and thereby the
attainment of man's highest aim. That passages notifying certain
divinities, and so on, stand in subordinate relation to acts of
devout meditation mentioned in the same chapters may readily be
admitted. But it is impossible that Brahman should stand in an
analogous relation to injunctions of devout meditation, for if the
knowledge of absolute unity has once arisen there exists no longer
anything to be desired or avoided, and thereby the conception of
duality, according to which we distinguish actions, agents, and the
like, is destroyed. If the conception of duality is once uprooted
by the conception of absolute unity, it cannot arise again, and so
no longer be the cause of Brahman being looked upon as the
complementary object of injunctions of devotion. Other parts of the
Veda may have no authority except in so far as they are connected
with injunctions; still it is impossible to impugn on that ground
the authoritativeness of passages conveying the knowledge of the
Self; for such passages have their own result. Nor, finally, can
the authoritativeness of the Veda be proved by inferential
reasoning so that it would be dependent on instances observed
elsewhere. From all which it follows that the Veda possesses
authority as a means of right knowledge of Brahman.</p>
<p>Here others raise the following objection:&mdash;Although the
Veda is the means of gaining a right knowledge of Brahman, yet it
intimates Brahman only as the object of certain injunctions, just
as the information which the Veda gives about the sacrificial post,
the &acirc;havan&icirc;ya-fire and other objects not known from the
practice of common life is merely supplementary to certain
injunctions<a id="footnotetag69" name="footnotetag69"></a><a href=
"#footnote69"><sup>69</sup></a>. Why so? <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>{24}</span> Because the
Veda has the purport of either instigating to action or restraining
from it. For men fully acquainted with the object of the Veda have
made the following declaration, 'The purpose of the Veda is seen to
be the injunction of actions' (Bh&acirc;shya on Jaimini S&ucirc;tra
I, 1, 1); 'Injunction means passages impelling to action' (Bh. on
Jaim. S&ucirc;. I, 1, 2); 'Of this (viz. active religious duty) the
knowledge comes from injunction' (part of Jaim. S&ucirc;. I, 1, 5);
'The (words) denoting those (things) are to be connected with (the
injunctive verb of the vidhi-passage) whose purport is action'
(Jaim. S&ucirc;. I, 1, 25); 'As action is the purport of the Veda,
whatever does not refer to action is purportless' (Jaim. S&ucirc;.
I, 2, 1). Therefore the Veda has a purport in so far only as it
rouses the activity of man with regard to some actions and
restrains it with regard to others; other passages (i.e. all those
passages which are not directly injunctive) have a purport only in
so far as they supplement injunctions and prohibitions. Hence the
Ved&acirc;nta-texts also as likewise belonging to the Veda can have
a meaning in the same way only. And if their aim is injunction,
then just as the agnihotra-oblation and other rites are enjoined as
means for him who is desirous of the heavenly world, so the
knowledge of Brahman is enjoined as a means for him who is desirous
of immortality.&mdash;But&mdash;somebody might object&mdash;it has
been declared that there is a difference in the character of the
objects enquired into, the object of enquiry in the
karma-k&acirc;<i>nd</i>a (that part of the Veda which treats of
active religious duty) being something to be accomplished, viz.
duty, while here the object is the already existent absolutely
accomplished Brahman. From this it follows that the fruit of the
knowledge of Brahman must be of a different nature from the fruit
of the knowledge of duty which depends on the performance of
actions<a id="footnotetag70" name="footnotetag70"></a><a href=
"#footnote70"><sup>70</sup></a>.&mdash;We reply that it must not be
such because the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id=
"page25"></a>{25}</span> Ved&acirc;nta-texts give information about
Brahman only in so far as it is connected with injunctions of
actions. We meet with injunctions of the following kind, 'Verily
the Self is to be seen' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. II, 4, 5); 'The Self which
is free from sin that it is which we must search out, that it is
which we must try to understand' (Ch. Up. VIII, 7, 1); 'Let a man
worship him as Self' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. I, 4, 7); 'Let a man worship
the Self only as his true state' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. I, 4, 15); 'He
who knows Brahman becomes Brahman' (Mu. Up. III, 2, 9). These
injunctions rouse in us the desire to know what that Brahman is.
It, therefore, is the task of the Ved&acirc;nta-texts to set forth
Brahman's nature, and they perform that task by teaching us that
Brahman is eternal, all-knowing, absolutely self-sufficient, ever
pure, intelligent and free, pure knowledge, absolute bliss. From
the devout meditation on this Brahman there results as its fruit,
final release, which, although not to be discerned in the ordinary
way, is discerned by means of the <i>s</i>&acirc;stra. If, on the
other hand, the Ved&acirc;nta-texts were considered to have no
reference to injunctions of actions, but to contain statements
about mere (accomplished) things, just as if one were saying 'the
earth comprises seven dvipas,' 'that king is marching on,' they
would be purportless, because then they could not possibly be
connected with something to be shunned or endeavoured
after.&mdash;Perhaps it will here be objected that sometimes a mere
statement about existent things has a purpose, as, for instance,
the affirmation, 'This is a rope, not a snake,' serves the purpose
of removing the fear engendered by an erroneous opinion, and that
so likewise the Ved&acirc;nta-passages making statements about the
non-transmigrating Self, have a purport of their own (without
reference to any action), viz. in so far as they remove the
erroneous opinion of the Self being liable to
transmigration.&mdash;We reply that this might <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>{26}</span> be so if
just as the mere hearing of the true nature of the rope dispels the
fear caused by the imagined snake, so the mere hearing of the true
nature of Brahman would dispel the erroneous notion of one's being
subject to transmigration. But this is not the case; for we observe
that even men to whom the true nature of Brahman has been stated
continue to be affected by pleasure, pain, and the other qualities
attaching to the transmigratory condition. Moreover, we see from
the passage, <i>Bri</i>. Up. II, 4, 5, 'The Self is to be heard, to
be considered, to be reflected upon,' that consideration and
reflection have to follow the mere hearing. From all this it
results that the s&acirc;stra can be admitted as a means of knowing
Brahman in so far only as the latter is connected with
injunctions.</p>
<p>To all this, we, the Ved&acirc;ntins, make the following
reply:&mdash;The preceding reasoning is not valid, on account of
the different nature of the fruits of actions on the one side, and
of the knowledge of Brahman on the other side. The enquiry into
those actions, whether of body, speech, or mind, which are known
from <i>S</i>ruti and Sm<i>ri</i>ti, and are comprised under the
name 'religious duty' (dharma), is carried on in the Jaimini
S&ucirc;tra, which begins with the words 'then therefore the
enquiry into duty;' the opposite of duty also (adharma), such as
doing harm, &amp;c., which is defined in the prohibitory
injunctions, forms an object of enquiry to the end that it may be
avoided. The fruits of duty, which is good, and its opposite, which
is evil, both of which are defined by original Vedic statements,
are generally known to be sensible pleasure and pain, which make
themselves felt to body, speech, and mind only, are produced by the
contact of the organs of sense with the objects, and affect all
animate beings from Brahman down to a tuft of grass. Scripture,
agreeing with observation, states that there are differences in the
degree of pleasure of all embodied creatures from men upward to
Brahman. From those differences it is inferred that there are
differences in the degrees of the merit acquired by actions in
accordance with religious duty; therefrom again are inferred
differences in degree between those qualified to perform
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>{27}</span>
acts of religious duty. Those latter differences are moreover known
to be affected by the desire of certain results (which entitles the
man so desirous to perform certain religious acts), worldly
possessions, and the like. It is further known from Scripture that
those only who perform sacrifices proceed, in consequence of the
pre-eminence of their knowledge and meditation, on the northern
path (of the sun; Ch. Up. V, 10, 1), while mere minor offerings,
works of public utility and alms, only lead through smoke and the
other stages to the southern path. And that there also (viz. in the
moon which is finally reached by those who have passed along the
southern path) there are degrees of pleasure and the means of
pleasure is understood from the passage 'Having dwelt there till
their works are consumed.' Analogously it is understood that the
different degrees of pleasure which are enjoyed by the embodied
creatures, from man downward to the inmates of hell and to
immovable things, are the mere effects of religious merit as
defined in Vedic injunctions. On the other hand, from the different
degrees of pain endured by higher and lower embodied creatures,
there is inferred difference of degree in its cause, viz. religious
demerit as defined in the prohibitory injunctions, and in its
agents. This difference in the degree of pain and pleasure, which
has for its antecedent embodied existence, and for its cause the
difference of degree of merit and demerit of animated beings,
liable to faults such as ignorance and the like, is well
known&mdash;from <i>S</i>ruti, Sm<i>ri</i>ti, and
reasoning&mdash;to be non-eternal, of a fleeting, changing nature
(sa<i>m</i>s&acirc;ra). The following text, for instance, 'As long
as he is in the body he cannot get free from pleasure and pain'
(Ch. Up. VIII, 12, 1), refers to the sa<i>m</i>s&acirc;ra-state as
described above. From the following passage, on the other hand,
'When he is free from the body then neither pleasure nor pain
touches him,' which denies the touch of pain or pleasure, we learn
that the unembodied state called 'final release' (moksha) is
declared not to be the effect of religious merit as defined by
Vedic injunctions. For if it were the effect of merit it would not
be denied that it is subject to pain and pleasure. Should it be
said <span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id=
"page28"></a>{28}</span> that the very circumstance of its being an
unembodied state is the effect of merit, we reply that that cannot
be, since Scripture declares that state to be naturally and
originally an unembodied one. 'The wise who knows the Self as
bodiless within the bodies, as unchanging among changing things, as
great and omnipresent does never grieve' (Ka. Up. II, 22); 'He is
without breath, without mind, pure' (Mu. Up. II, 1, 2); 'That
person is not attached to anything' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. IV, 3,
15)<a id="footnotetag71" name="footnotetag71"></a><a href=
"#footnote71"><sup>71</sup></a>. All which passages establish the
fact that so-called release differs from all the fruits of action,
and is an eternally and essentially disembodied state. Among
eternal things, some indeed may be 'eternal, although changing'
(pari<i>n</i>&acirc;minitya), viz. those, the idea of whose
identity is not destroyed, although they may undergo changes; such,
for instance, are earth and the other elements in the opinion of
those who maintain the eternity of the world, or the three
gu<i>n</i>as in the opinion of the S&acirc;@nkhyas. But this
(moksha) is eternal in the true sense, i.e. eternal without
undergoing any changes (k&ucirc;<i>ta</i>sthanitya), omnipresent as
ether, free from all modifications, absolutely self-sufficient, not
composed of parts, of self-luminous nature. That bodiless entity in
fact, to which merit and demerit with their consequences and
threefold time do not apply, is called release; a definition
agreeing with scriptural passages, such as the following:
'Different from merit and demerit, different from effect and cause,
different from past and future' (Ka. Up. I, 2, 14). It<a id=
"footnotetag72" name="footnotetag72"></a><a href=
"#footnote72"><sup>72</sup></a> (i.e. moksha) is, therefore, the
same as Brahman in the enquiry into which we are at present
engaged. If Brahman were represented as supplementary to certain
actions, and release <span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id=
"page29"></a>{29}</span> were assumed to be the effect of those
actions, it would be non-eternal, and would have to be considered
merely as something holding a pre-eminent position among the
described non-eternal fruits of actions with their various degrees.
But that release is something eternal is acknowledged by whoever
admits it at all, and the teaching concerning Brahman can therefore
not be merely supplementary to actions.</p>
<p>There are, moreover, a number of scriptural passages which
declare release to follow immediately on the cognition of Brahman,
and which thus preclude the possibility of an effect intervening
between the two; for instance, 'He who knows Brahman becomes
Brahman' (Mu. Up. III, 2, 9); 'All his works perish when He has
been beheld, who is the higher and the lower' (Mu. Up. II, 2, 8);
'He who knows the bliss of Brahman fears nothing' (Taitt. Up. II,
9); 'O Janaka, you have indeed reached fearlessness' (B<i>ri</i>.
Up. IV, 2, 4); 'That Brahman knew its Self only, saying, I am
Brahman. From it all this sprang' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. I, 4, 10); 'What
sorrow, what trouble can there be to him who beholds that unity?'
(&Icirc;s. Up. 7.) We must likewise quote the
passage,&mdash;B<i>ri</i>. Up. I, 4, 10, ('Seeing this the
<i>Ri</i>shi V&acirc;madeva understood: I was Manu, I was the
sun,') in order to exclude the idea of any action taking place
between one's seeing Brahman and becoming one with the universal
Self; for that passage is analogous to the following one, 'standing
he sings,' from which we understand that no action due to the same
agent intervenes between the standing and the singing. Other
scriptural passages show that the removal of the obstacles which
lie in the way of release is the only fruit of the knowledge of
Brahman; so, for instance, 'You indeed are our father, you who
carry us from our ignorance to the other shore' (Pr. Up. VI, 8); 'I
have heard from men like you that he who knows the Self overcomes
grief. I am in grief. Do, Sir, help me over this grief of mine'
(Ch. Up. VII, 1, 3); 'To him after his faults had been rubbed out,
the venerable Sanatkum&acirc;ra showed the other side of darkness'
(Ch. Up. VII, 26, 2). The same is the purport of the S&ucirc;tra,
supported by arguments, of (Gautama) &Acirc;k&acirc;rya, 'Final
release <span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id=
"page30"></a>{30}</span> results from the successive removal of
wrong knowledge, faults, activity, birth, pain, the removal of each
later member of the series depending on the removal of the
preceding member' (Ny&acirc;y. S&ucirc;. I, i, 2); and wrong
knowledge itself is removed by the knowledge of one's Self being
one with the Self of Brahman.</p>
<p>Nor is this knowledge of the Self being one with Brahman a mere
(fanciful) combination<a id="footnotetag73" name=
"footnotetag73"></a><a href="#footnote73"><sup>73</sup></a>, as is
made use of, for instance, in the following passage, 'For the mind
is endless, and the Vi<i>s</i>vedevas are endless, and he thereby
gains the endless world' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. III, 1, 9)<a id=
"footnotetag74" name="footnotetag74"></a><a href=
"#footnote74"><sup>74</sup></a>; nor is it an (in reality
unfounded) ascription (superimposition)<a id="footnotetag75" name=
"footnotetag75"></a><a href="#footnote75"><sup>75</sup></a>, as in
the passages, 'Let him meditate on mind as Brahman,' and
'&Acirc;ditya is Brahman, this is the doctrine' (Ch. Up. III, 18,
1; 19, 1), where the contemplation as Brahman is superimposed on
the mind, &Acirc;ditya and so on; nor, again, is it (a figurative
conception of identity) founded on the connection (of the things
viewed as identical) with some special activity, as in the passage,
'Air is indeed the absorber; breath is indeed the absorber<a id=
"footnotetag76" name="footnotetag76"></a><a href=
"#footnote76"><sup>76</sup></a>' (Ch. Up. IV, 3, 1; 3); nor is it a
mere (ceremonial) purification of (the Self constituting a
subordinate member) of an action (viz. the action of seeing,
&amp;c., Brahman), in the same way as, for instance, the act of
looking at the sacrificial <span class="pagenum"><a name="page31"
id="page31"></a>{31}</span> butter<a id="footnotetag77" name=
"footnotetag77"></a><a href="#footnote77"><sup>77</sup></a>. For if
the knowledge of the identity of the Self and Brahman were
understood in the way of combination and the like, violence would
be done thereby to the connection of the words whose object, in
certain passages, it clearly is to intimate the fact of Brahman and
the Self being really identical; so, for instance, in the following
passages, 'That art thou' (Ch. Up. VI, 8, 7); 'I am Brahman'
(B<i>ri</i>. Up. I, 4, 10); 'This Self is Brahman' (B<i>ri</i>. Up.
II, 5, 19). And other texts which declare that the fruit of the
cognition of Brahman is the cessation of Ignorance would be
contradicted thereby; so, for instance, 'The fetter of the heart is
broken, all doubts are solved' (Mu. Up. II, 2, 8). Nor, finally,
would it be possible, in that case, satisfactorily to explain the
passages which speak of the individual Self becoming Brahman: such
as 'He who knows Brahman becomes Brahman' (Mu. Up. III, 2, 9).
Hence the knowledge of the unity of Brahman and the Self cannot be
of the nature of figurative combination and the like. The knowledge
of Brahman does, therefore, not depend on the active energy of man,
but is analogous to the knowledge of those things which are the
objects of perception, inference, and so on, and thus depends on
the object of knowledge only. Of such a Brahman or its knowledge it
is impossible to establish, by reasoning, any connection with
actions.</p>
<p>Nor, again, can we connect Brahman with acts by representing it
as the object of the action of knowing. For that it is not such is
expressly declared in two passages, viz. 'It is different from the
known and again above (i.e. different from) the unknown' (Ken. Up.
I, 3); and 'How should he know him by whom he knows all this?'
(B<i>ri</i>. Up. II, 4, 13.) In the same way Brahman is expressly
declared not to be the object of the act of devout meditation, viz.
in the second half of the verse, Ken. Up. I, 5, whose first half
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>{32}</span>
declares it not to be an object (of speech, mind, and so on), 'That
which is not proclaimed by speech, by which speech is proclaimed,
that only know to be Brahman, not that on which people devoutly
meditate as this.' If it should be objected that if Brahman is not
an object (of speech, mind, &amp;c.) the s&acirc;stra can
impossibly be its source, we refute this objection by the remark
that the aim of the s&acirc;stra is to discard all distinctions
fictitiously created by Nescience. The s&acirc;stra's purport is
not to represent Brahman definitely as this or that object, its
purpose is rather to show that Brahman as the eternal subject
(pratyag&acirc;tman, the inward Self) is never an object, and
thereby to remove the distinction of objects known, knowers, acts
of knowledge, &amp;c., which is fictitiously created by Nescience.
Accordingly the s&acirc;stra says, 'By whom it is not thought by
him it is thought, by whom it is thought he does not know it;
unknown by those who know it, it is known by those who do not know
it' (Ken. Up. II, 3); and 'Thou couldst not see the seer of sight,
thou couldst not hear the hearer of hearing, nor perceive the
perceiver of perception, nor know the knower of knowledge'
(B<i>ri</i>. Up. III, 4, 2). As thereby (i.e. by the knowledge
derived from the s&acirc;stra) the imagination of the
transitoriness of Release which is due to Nescience is discarded,
and Release is shown to be of the nature of the eternally free
Self, it cannot be charged with the imperfection of non-eternality.
Those, on the other hand, who consider Release to be something to
be effected properly maintain that it depends on the action of
mind, speech, or body. So, likewise, those who consider it to be a
mere modification. Non-eternality of Release is the certain
consequence of these two opinions; for we observe in common life
that things which are modifications, such as sour milk and the
like, and things which are effects, such as jars, &amp;c., are
non-eternal. Nor, again, can it be said that there is a dependance
on action in consequence of (Brahman or Release) being something
which is to be obtained<a id="footnotetag78" name=
"footnotetag78"></a><a href="#footnote78"><sup>78</sup></a>; for as
Brahman constitutes a person's Self it is <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>{33}</span> not
something to be attained by that person. And even if Brahman were
altogether different from a person's Self still it would not be
something to be obtained; for as it is omnipresent it is part of
its nature that it is ever present to every one, just as the
(all-pervading) ether is. Nor, again, can it be maintained that
Release is something to be ceremonially purified, and as such
depends on an activity. For ceremonial purification
(sa<i>m</i>sk&acirc;ra) results either from the accretion of some
excellence or from the removal of some blemish. The former
alternative does not apply to Release as it is of the nature of
Brahman, to which no excellence can be added; nor, again, does the
latter alternative apply, since Release is of the nature of
Brahman, which is eternally pure.&mdash;But, it might be said,
Release might be a quality of the Self which is merely hidden and
becomes manifest on the Self being purified by some action; just as
the quality of clearness becomes manifest in a mirror when the
mirror is cleaned by means of the action of rubbing.&mdash;This
objection is invalid, we reply, because the Self cannot be the
abode of any action. For an action cannot exist without modifying
that in which it abides. But if the Self were modified by an action
its non-eternality would result therefrom, and texts such as the
following, 'unchangeable he is called,' would thus be stultified;
an altogether unacceptable result. Hence it is impossible to assume
that any action should abide in the Self. On the other hand, the
Self cannot be purified by actions abiding in something else as it
stands in no relation to that extraneous something. Nor will it
avail to point out (as a quasi-analogous case) that the embodied
Self (dehin, the individual soul) is purified by certain ritual
actions which abide in the body, such as bathing, rinsing one's
mouth, wearing the sacrificial thread, and the like. For what is
purified by those actions is that Self merely which is joined to
the body, i.e. the Self in so far as it is under the power of
Nescience. For it is a matter of perception <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>{34}</span> that bathing
and similar actions stand in the relation of inherence to the body,
and it is therefore only proper to conclude that by such actions
only that something is purified which is joined to the body. If a
person thinks 'I am free from disease,' he predicates health of
that entity only which is connected with and mistakenly identifies
itself with the harmonious condition of matter (i.e. the body)
resulting from appropriate medical treatment applied to the body
(i.e. the 'I' constituting the subject of predication is only the
individual embodied Self). Analogously that I which predicates of
itself, that it is purified by bathing and the like, is only the
individual soul joined to the body. For it is only this latter
principle of egoity (aha<i>m</i>kart<i>ri</i>), the object of the
notion of the ego and the agent in all cognition, which
accomplishes all actions and enjoys their results. Thus the mantras
also declare, 'One of them eats the sweet fruit, the other looks on
without eating' (Mu. Up. III, 1, 1); and 'When he is in union with
the body, the senses, and the mind, then wise people call him the
Enjoyer' (Ka. Up. III, 1, 4). Of Brahman, on the other hand, the
two following passages declare that it is incapable of receiving
any accretion and eternally pure, 'He is the one God, hidden in all
beings, all-pervading, the Self within all beings, watching over
all works, dwelling in all beings, the witness, the perceiver, the
only one; free from qualities' (<i>S</i>v. Up. VI, 11); and 'He
pervaded all, bright, incorporeal, scatheless, without muscles,
pure, untouched by evil' (&Icirc;<i>s</i>. Up. 8). But Release is
nothing but being Brahman. Therefore Release is not something to be
purified. And as nobody is able to show any other way in which
Release could be connected with action, it is impossible that it
should stand in any, even the slightest, relation to any action,
excepting knowledge.</p>
<p>But, it will be said here, knowledge itself is an activity of
the mind. By no means, we reply; since the two are of different
nature. An action is that which is enjoined as being independent of
the nature of existing things and dependent on the energy of some
person's mind; compare, for instance, the following passages, 'To
whichever divinity the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id=
"page35"></a>{35}</span> offering is made on that one let him
meditate when about to say vasha<i>t</i>' (Ait. Br&acirc;hm. III,
8, 1); and 'Let him meditate in his mind on the sandhy&acirc;.'
Meditation and reflection are indeed mental, but as they depend on
the (meditating, &amp;c.) person they may either be performed or
not be performed or modified. Knowledge, on the other hand, is the
result of the different means of (right) knowledge, and those have
for their objects existing things; knowledge can therefore not be
either made or not made or modified, but depends entirely on
existing things, and not either on Vedic statements or on the mind
of man. Although mental it thus widely differs from meditation and
the like.</p>
<p>The meditation, for instance, on man and woman as fire, which is
founded on Ch. Up. V, 7, 1; 8, 1, 'The fire is man, O Gautama; the
fire is woman, O Gautama,' is on account of its being the result of
a Vedic statement, merely an action and dependent on man; that
conception of fire, on the other hand, which refers to the
well-known (real) fire, is neither dependent on Vedic statements
nor on man, but only on a real thing which is an object of
perception; it is therefore knowledge and not an action. The same
remark applies to all things which are the objects of the different
means of right knowledge. This being thus that knowledge also which
has the existent Brahman for its object is not dependent on Vedic
injunction. Hence, although imperative and similar forms referring
to the knowledge of Brahman are found in the Vedic texts, yet they
are ineffective because they refer to something which cannot be
enjoined, just as the edge of a razor becomes blunt when it is
applied to a stone. For they have for their object something which
can neither be endeavoured after nor avoided.&mdash;But what then,
it will be asked, is the purport of those sentences which, at any
rate, have the appearance of injunctions; such as, 'The Self is to
be seen, to be heard about?'&mdash;They have the purport, we reply,
of diverting (men) from the objects of natural activity. For when a
man acts intent on external things, and only anxious to attain the
objects of his desire and to eschew the objects of his aversion,
and does not thereby reach the highest aim of man although desirous
of attaining it; such <span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id=
"page36"></a>{36}</span> texts as the one quoted divert him from
the objects of natural activity and turn the stream of his thoughts
on the inward (the highest) Self. That for him who is engaged in
the enquiry into the Self, the true nature of the Self is nothing
either to be endeavoured after or to be avoided, we learn from
texts such as the following: 'This everything, all is that Self'
(B<i>ri</i>, Up. II, 4, 6); 'But when the Self only is all this,
how should he see another, how should he know another, how should
he know the knower?' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. IV, 5, 15); 'This Self is
Brahman' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. II, 5, 19). That the knowledge of Brahman
refers to something which is not a thing to be done, and therefore
is not concerned either with the pursuit or the avoidance of any
object, is the very thing we admit; for just that constitutes our
glory, that as soon as we comprehend Brahman, all our duties come
to an end and all our work is over. Thus <i>S</i>ruti says, 'If a
man understands the Self, saying, "I am he," what could he wish or
desire that he should pine after the body?' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. IV, 4,
12.) And similarly Sm<i>ri</i>ti declares, 'Having understood this
the understanding man has done with all work, O Bh&acirc;rata'
(Bha. G&icirc;t&acirc; XV, 20). Therefore Brahman is not
represented as the object of injunctions.</p>
<p>We now proceed to consider the doctrine of those who maintain
that there is no part of the Veda which has the purport of making
statements about mere existent things, and is not either an
injunction or a prohibition, or supplementary to either. This
opinion is erroneous, because the soul (purusha), which is the
subject of the Upanishads, does not constitute a complement to
anything else. Of that soul which is to be comprehended from the
Upanishads only, which is non-transmigratory, Brahman, different in
nature from the four classes of substances<a id="footnotetag79"
name="footnotetag79"></a><a href="#footnote79"><sup>79</sup></a>,
which forms a topic of its own and is not a complement to anything
else; of that <span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id=
"page37"></a>{37}</span> soul it is impossible to say that it is
not or is not apprehended; for the passage, 'That Self is to be
described by No, no!' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. III, 9, 26) designates it as
the Self, and that the Self is cannot be denied. The possible
objection that there is no reason to maintain that the soul is
known from the Upanishads only, since it is the object of
self-consciousness, is refuted by the fact that the soul of which
the Upanishads treat is merely the witness of that (i.e. of the
object of self-consciousness, viz. the j&icirc;v&acirc;tman). For
neither from that part of the Veda which enjoins works nor from
reasoning, anybody apprehends that soul which, different from the
agent that is the object of self-consciousness, merely witnesses
it; which is permanent in all (transitory) beings; uniform; one;
eternally unchanging; the Self of everything. Hence it can neither
be denied nor be represented as the mere complement of injunctions;
for of that very person who might deny it it is the Self. And as it
is the Self of all, it can neither be striven after nor avoided.
All perishable things indeed perish, because they are mere
modifications, up to (i.e. exclusive of) the soul. But the soul is
imperishable<a id="footnotetag80" name="footnotetag80"></a><a href=
"#footnote80"><sup>80</sup></a>, as there is no cause why it should
perish; and eternally unchanging, as there is no cause for its
undergoing any modification; hence it is in its essence eternally
pure and free. And from passages, such as 'Beyond the soul there is
nothing; this is the goal, the highest road' (Ka. Up. I, 3, 11),
and 'That soul, taught in the Upanishads, I ask thee' (B<i>ri</i>.
Up. III, 9, 26), it appears that the attribute of resting on the
Upanishads is properly given to the soul, as it constitutes their
chief topic. To say, therefore, that there is no portion of the
Veda referring to existing things, is a mere bold assertion.</p>
<p>With regard to the quotations made of the views of men
acquainted with the purport of the <i>S</i>&acirc;stra (who alone
were stated to have declared that the Veda treats of actions) it is
to be understood that they, having to do with the enquiry into
duty, refer to that part of the <i>S</i>&acirc;stra which consists
of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id=
"page38"></a>{38}</span> injunctions and prohibitions. With regard
to the other passage quoted ('as action is the purport of the Veda,
whatever does not refer to action is purportless') we remark that
if that passage were taken in an absolutely strict sense (when it
would mean that only those words which denote action have a
meaning), it would follow that all information about existent
things is meaningless<a id="footnotetag81" name=
"footnotetag81"></a><a href="#footnote81"><sup>81</sup></a>. If, on
the other hand, the Veda&mdash;in addition to the injunctions of
activity and cessation of activity&mdash;does give information
about existent things as being subservient to some action to be
accomplished, why then should it not give information also about
the existent eternally unchangeable Self? For an existent thing,
about which information is given, does not become an act (through
being stated to be subservient to an act).&mdash;But, it will be
said, although existent things are not acts, yet, as they are
instrumental to action, the information given about such things is
merely subservient to action.&mdash;This, we reply, does not
matter; for although the information may be subservient to action,
the things themselves about which information is given are already
intimated thereby as things which have the power of bringing about
certain actions. Their final end (prayojana) indeed may be
subserviency to some action, but thereby they do not cease to be,
in the information given about them, intimated in
themselves.&mdash;Well, and if they are thus intimated, what is
gained thereby for your purpose<a id="footnotetag82" name=
"footnotetag82"></a><a href="#footnote82"><sup>82</sup></a>? We
reply that the information about the Self, which is an existing
thing not comprehended from other sources, is of the same nature
(as the information about other existent things); for by the
comprehension of the Self a stop is put to all false knowledge,
which is the cause of transmigration, and thus a <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>{39}</span> purpose is
established which renders the passages relative to Brahman equal to
those passages which give information about things instrumental to
actions. Moreover, there are found (even in that part of the Veda
which treats of actions) such passages as 'a Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a
is not to be killed,' which teach abstinence from certain actions.
Now abstinence from action is neither action nor instrumental to
action. If, therefore, the tenet that all those passages which do
not express action are devoid of purport were insisted on, it would
follow that all such passages as the one quoted, which teach
abstinence from action, are devoid of purport&mdash;a consequence
which is of course unacceptable. Nor, again, can the connexion in
which the word 'not' stands with the action expressed by the verb
'is to be killed'&mdash;which action is naturally established<a id=
"footnotetag83" name="footnotetag83"></a><a href=
"#footnote83"><sup>83</sup></a>&mdash;be used as a reason for
assuming that 'not' denotes an action non-established
elsewhere<a id="footnotetag84" name="footnotetag84"></a><a href=
"#footnote84"><sup>84</sup></a>, different from the state of mere
passivity implied in the abstinence from the act of killing. For
the peculiar function of the particle 'not' is to intimate the idea
of the non-existence of that with which it is connected, and the
conception of the non-existence (of something to be done) is the
cause of the state of passivity. (Nor can it be objected that, as
soon as that momentary idea has passed away, the state of passivity
will again make room for activity; for) that idea itself passes
away (only after having completely destroyed the natural impulse
prompting to the murder of a Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a, &amp;c., just
as a fire is extinguished only after having completely consumed its
fuel). Hence we are of opinion that the aim of prohibitory
passages, such as 'a Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a is not to be killed,' is
a merely passive state, consisting in the abstinence from some
possible action; excepting some special cases, such as the
so-called Praj&acirc;pati-vow, &amp;c.<a id="footnotetag85" name=
"footnotetag85"></a><a href="#footnote85"><sup>85</sup></a> Hence
the charge of want of purpose is to be <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>{40}</span> considered
as referring (not to the Ved&acirc;nta-passages, but only) to such
statements about existent things as are of the nature of legends
and the like, and do not serve any purpose of man.</p>
<p>The allegation that a mere statement about an actually existent
thing not connected with an injunction of something to be done, is
purposeless (as, for instance, the statement that the earth
contains seven dv&icirc;pas) has already been refuted on the ground
that a purpose is seen to exist in some such statements, as, for
instance, 'this is not a snake, but a rope.'&mdash;But how about
the objection raised above that the information about Brahman
cannot be held to have a purpose in the same way as the statement
about a rope has one, because a man even after having heard about
Brahman continues to belong to this transmigratory <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>{41}</span>
world?&mdash;We reply as follows: It is impossible to show that a
man who has once understood Brahman to be the Self, belongs to the
transmigratory world in the same sense as he did before, because
that would be contrary to the fact of his being Brahman. For we
indeed observe that a person who imagines the body, and so on, to
constitute the Self, is subject to fear and pain, but we have no
right to assume that the same person after having, by means of the
Veda, comprehended Brahman to be the Self, and thus having got over
his former imaginings, will still in the same manner be subject to
pain and fear whose cause is wrong knowledge. In the same way we
see that a rich householder, puffed up by the conceit of his
wealth, is grieved when his possessions are taken from him; but we
do not see that the loss of his wealth equally grieves him after he
has once retired from the world and put off the conceit of his
riches. And, again, we see that a person possessing a pair of
beautiful earrings derives pleasure from the proud conceit of
ownership; but after he has lost the earrings and the conceit
established thereon, the pleasure derived from them vanishes. Thus
<i>S</i>ruti also declares, 'When he is free from the body, then
neither pleasure nor pain touches him' (Ch. Up. VIII, 12, 1). If it
should be objected that the condition of being free from the body
follows on death only, we demur, since the cause of man being
joined to the body is wrong knowledge. For it is not possible to
establish the state of embodiedness upon anything else but wrong
knowledge. And that the state of disembodiedness is eternal on
account of its not having actions for its cause, we have already
explained. The objection again, that embodiedness is caused by the
merit and demerit effected by the Self (and therefore real), we
refute by remarking that as the (reality of the) conjunction of the
Self with the body is itself not established, the circumstance of
merit and demerit being due to the action of the Self is likewise
not established; for (if we should try to get over this difficulty
by representing the Self's embodiedness as caused by merit and
demerit) we should commit the logical fault of making embodiedness
dependent on merit and demerit, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page42" id="page42"></a>{42}</span> and again merit and demerit on
embodiedness. And the assumption of an endless retrogressive chain
(of embodied states and merit and demerit) would be no better than
a chain of blind men (who are unable to lead one another).
Moreover, the Self can impossibly become an agent, as it cannot
enter into intimate relation to actions. If it should be said that
the Self may be considered as an agent in the same way as kings and
other great people are (who without acting themselves make others
act) by their mere presence, we deny the appositeness of this
instance; for kings may become agents through their relation to
servants whom they procure by giving them wages, &amp;c., while it
is impossible to imagine anything, analogous to money, which could
be the cause of a connexion between the Self as lord and the body,
and so on (as servants). Wrong imagination, on the other hand, (of
the individual Self, considering itself to be joined to the body,)
is a manifest reason of the connexion of the two (which is not
based on any assumption). This explains also in how far the Self
can be considered as the agent in sacrifices and similar acts<a id=
"footnotetag86" name="footnotetag86"></a><a href=
"#footnote86"><sup>86</sup></a>. Here it is objected that the
Self's imagination as to the body, and so on, belonging to itself
is not false, but is to be understood in a derived (figurative)
sense. This objection we invalidate by the remark that the
distinction of derived and primary senses of words is known to be
applicable only where an actual difference of things is known to
exist. We are, for instance, acquainted with a certain species of
animals having a mane, and so on, which is the exclusive primary
object of the idea and word 'lion,' and we are likewise acquainted
with persons possessing in an eminent degree certain leonine
qualities, such as fierceness, courage, &amp;c.; here, a well
settled difference of objects existing, the idea and the name
'lion' are applied to those persons in a derived or figurative
sense. In those cases, however, where the difference of the objects
is not well established, the transfer of the conception and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>{43}</span>
name of the one to the other is not figurative, but simply founded
on error. Such is, for instance, the case of a man who at the time
of twilight does not discern that the object before him is a post,
and applies to it the conception and designation of a man; such is
likewise the case of the conception and designation of silver being
applied to a shell of mother-of-pearl somehow mistaken for silver.
How then can it be maintained that the application of the word and
the conception of the Ego to the body, &amp;c., which application
is due to the non-discrimination of the Self and the Not-Self, is
figurative (rather than simply false)? considering that even
learned men who know the difference of the Self and the Not-Self
confound the words and ideas just as common shepherds and goatherds
do.</p>
<p>As therefore the application of the conception of the Ego to the
body on the part of those who affirm the existence of a Self
different from the body is simply false, not figurative, it follows
that the embodiedness of the Self is (not real but) caused by wrong
conception, and hence that the person who has reached true
knowledge is free from his body even while still alive. The same is
declared in the <i>S</i>ruti passages concerning him who knows
Brahman: 'And as the slough of a snake lies on an ant-hill, dead
and cast away, thus lies this body; but that disembodied immortal
spirit is Brahman only, is only light' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. IV, 4, 7);
and 'With eyes he is without eyes as it were, with ears without
ears as it were, with speech without speech as it were, with a mind
without mind as it were, with vital airs without vital airs as it
were.' Sm<i>ri</i>ti also, in the passage where the characteristic
marks are enumerated of one whose mind is steady (Bha.
G&icirc;t&acirc; II, 54), declares that he who knows is no longer
connected with action of any kind. Therefore the man who has once
comprehended Brahman to be the Self, does not belong to this
transmigratory world as he did before. He, on the other hand, who
still belongs to this transmigratory world as before, has not
comprehended Brahman to be the Self. Thus there remain no unsolved
contradictions.</p>
<p>With reference again to the assertion that Brahman is not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>{44}</span>
fully determined in its own nature, but stands in a complementary
relation to injunctions, because the hearing about Brahman is to be
followed by consideration and reflection, we remark that
consideration and reflection are themselves merely subservient to
the comprehension of Brahman. If Brahman, after having been
comprehended, stood in a subordinate relation to some injunctions,
it might be said to be merely supplementary. But this is not the
case, since consideration and reflection no less than hearing are
subservient to comprehension. It follows that the
<i>S</i>&acirc;stra cannot be the means of knowing Brahman only in
so far as it is connected with injunctions, and the doctrine that
on account of the uniform meaning of the Ved&acirc;nta-texts, an
independent Brahman is to be admitted, is thereby fully
established. Hence there is room for beginning the new
<i>S</i>&acirc;stra indicated in the first S&ucirc;tra, 'Then
therefore the enquiry into Brahman.' If, on the other hand, the
Ved&acirc;nta-texts were connected with injunctions, a new
<i>S</i>&acirc;stra would either not be begun at all, since the
<i>S</i>&acirc;stra concerned with injunctions has already been
introduced by means of the first S&ucirc;tra of the P&ucirc;rva
M&icirc;m&acirc;<i>m</i>s&acirc;, 'Then therefore the enquiry into
duty;' or if it were begun it would be introduced as follows: 'Then
therefore the enquiry into the remaining duties;' just as a new
portion of the P&ucirc;rva M&icirc;m&acirc;<i>m</i>s&acirc;
S&ucirc;tras is introduced with the words, 'Then therefore the
enquiry into what subserves the purpose of the sacrifice, and what
subserves the purpose of man' (P&ucirc;. M&icirc;. S&ucirc;. IV, 1,
1). But as the comprehension of the unity of Brahman and the Self
has not been propounded (in the previous <i>S</i>&acirc;stra), it
is quite appropriate that a new <i>S</i>&acirc;stra, whose subject
is Brahman, should be entered upon. Hence all injunctions and all
other means of knowledge end with the cognition expressed in the
words, 'I am Brahman;' for as soon as there supervenes the
comprehension of the non-dual Self, which is not either something
to be eschewed or something to be appropriated, all objects and
knowing agents vanish, and hence there can no longer be means of
proof. In accordance with this, they (i.e. men knowing Brahman)
have made the following declaration:&mdash;'When <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>{45}</span> there has
arisen (in a man's mind) the knowledge, "I am that which is,
Brahman is my Self," and when, owing to the sublation of the
conceptions of body, relatives, and the like, the (imagination of)
the figurative and the false Self has come to an end<a id=
"footnotetag87" name="footnotetag87"></a><a href=
"#footnote87"><sup>87</sup></a>; how should then the effect<a id=
"footnotetag88" name="footnotetag88"></a><a href=
"#footnote88"><sup>88</sup></a> (of that wrong imagination) exist
any longer? As long as the knowledge of the Self, which Scripture
tells us to search after, has not arisen, so long the Self is
knowing subject; but that same subject is that which is searched
after, viz. (the highest Self) free from all evil and blemish. Just
as the idea of the Self being the body is assumed as valid (in
ordinary life), so all the ordinary sources of knowledge
(perception and the like) are valid only until the one Self is
ascertained.'</p>
<p>(Herewith the section comprising the four S&ucirc;tras is
finished<a id="footnotetag89" name="footnotetag89"></a><a href=
"#footnote89"><sup>89</sup></a>.)</p>
<p>So far it has been declared that the Ved&acirc;nta-passages,
whose purport is the comprehension of Brahman being the Self, and
which have their object therein, refer exclusively to Brahman
without any reference to actions. And it has further been shown
that Brahman is the omniscient omnipotent cause of the origin,
subsistence, and dissolution of the world. But now the
S&acirc;@nkhyas and others being of opinion that an existent
substance is to be known through other means of proof (not through
the Veda) infer different causes, such as the pradh&acirc;na and
the like, and thereupon interpret the Ved&acirc;nta-passages as
referring to the latter. All the Ved&acirc;nta-passages, they
maintain, which treat of the creation of the world distinctly point
out that the cause (of the world) has to be concluded from the
effect by inference; and the cause which is to be inferred is the
connexion of the pradh&acirc;na with the souls (purusha). The
followers of Ka<i>n</i>&acirc;da again infer from the very same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>{46}</span>
passages that the Lord is the efficient cause of the world while
the atoms are its material cause. And thus other argumentators also
taking their stand on passages apparently favouring their views and
on fallacious arguments raise various objections. For this reason
the teacher (Vy&acirc;sa)&mdash;thoroughly acquainted as he is with
words, passages, and means of proof&mdash;proceeds to state as
prim&acirc; facie views, and afterwards to refute, all those
opinions founded on deceptive passages and fallacious arguments.
Thereby he at the same time proves indirectly that what the
Ved&acirc;nta-texts aim at is the comprehension of Brahman.</p>
<p>The S&acirc;@nkhyas who opine that the non-intelligent
pradh&acirc;na consisting of three constituent elements
(gu<i>n</i>a) is the cause of the world argue as follows. The
Ved&acirc;nta-passages which you have declared to intimate that the
all-knowing all-powerful Brahman is the cause of the world can be
consistently interpreted also on the doctrine of the pradh&acirc;na
being the general cause. Omnipotence (more literally: the
possession of all powers) can be ascribed to the pradh&acirc;na in
so far as it has all its effects for its objects. All-knowingness
also can be ascribed to it, viz. in the following manner. What you
think to be knowledge is in reality an attribute of the gu<i>n</i>a
of Goodness<a id="footnotetag90" name="footnotetag90"></a><a href=
"#footnote90"><sup>90</sup></a>, according to the Sm<i>ri</i>ti
passage 'from Goodness springs knowledge' (Bha. G&icirc;t&acirc;
XIV, 17). By means of this attribute of Goodness, viz. knowledge,
certain men endowed with organs which are effects (of the
pradh&acirc;na) are known as all-knowing Yogins; for omniscience is
acknowledged to be connected with the very highest degree of
'Goodness.' Now to the soul (purusha) which is isolated, destitute
of effected organs, consisting of pure (undifferenced) intelligence
it is quite impossible to ascribe either all-knowingness or limited
knowledge; the pradh&acirc;na, on the other hand, because
consisting of the three gu<i>n</i>as, comprises also in its
pradh&acirc;na state the element of Goodness which is the cause of
all-knowingness. The Ved&acirc;nta-passages therefore in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>{47}</span>
a derived (figurative) sense ascribe all-knowingness to the
pradh&acirc;na, although it is in itself non-intelligent. Moreover
you (the Ved&acirc;ntin) also who assume an all-knowing Brahman can
ascribe to it all-knowingness in so far only as that term means
capacity for all knowledge. For Brahman cannot always be actually
engaged in the cognition of everything; for from this there would
follow the absolute permanency of his cognition, and this would
involve a want of independence on Brahman's part with regard to the
activity of knowing. And if you should propose to consider
Brahman's cognition as non-permanent it would follow that with the
cessation of the cognition Brahman itself would cease. Therefore
all-knowingness is possible only in the sense of capacity for all
knowledge. Moreover you assume that previously to the origination
of the world Brahman is without any instruments of action. But
without the body, the senses, &amp;c. which are the instruments of
knowledge, cognition cannot take place in any being. And further it
must be noted that the pradh&acirc;na, as consisting of various
elements, is capable of undergoing modifications, and may therefore
act as a (material) cause like clay and other substances; while the
uncompounded homogeneous Brahman is unable to do so.</p>
<p>To these conclusions he (Vy&acirc;sa) replies in the following
S&ucirc;tra.</p>
<p>5. On account of seeing (i.e. thinking being attributed in the
Upanishads to the cause of the world; the pradh&acirc;na) is not
(to be identified with the cause indicated by the Upanishads; for)
it is not founded on Scripture.</p>
<p>It is impossible to find room in the Ved&acirc;nta-texts for the
non-intelligent pradh&acirc;na, the fiction of the S&acirc;@nkhyas;
because it is not founded on Scripture. How so? Because the quality
of seeing, i.e. thinking, is in Scripture ascribed to the cause.
For the passage, Ch. Up. VI, 2, (which begins: 'Being only, my
dear, this was in the beginning, one only, without a second,' and
goes on, 'It thought (saw), <span class="pagenum"><a name="page48"
id="page48"></a>{48}</span> may I be many, may I grow forth. It
sent forth fire,') declares that this world differentiated by name
and form, which is there denoted by the word 'this,' was before its
origination identical with the Self of that which is and that the
principle denoted by the term 'the being' (or 'that which is') sent
forth fire and the other elements after having thought. The
following passage also ('Verily in the beginning all this was Self,
one only; there was nothing else blinking whatsoever. He thought,
shall I send forth worlds? He sent forth these worlds,' Ait.
&Acirc;r. II, 4, 1, 2) declares the creation to have had thought
for its antecedent. In another passage also (Pr. Up. VI, 3) it is
said of the person of sixteen parts, 'He thought, &amp;c. He sent
forth Pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a.' By 'seeing' (i.e. the verb 'seeing'
exhibited in the S&ucirc;tra) is not meant that particular verb
only, but any verbs which have a cognate sense; just as the verb
'to sacrifice' is used to denote any kind of offering. Therefore
other passages also whose purport it is to intimate that an
all-knowing Lord is the cause of the world are to be quoted here,
as, for instance, Mu. Up. I, 1, 9, 'From him who perceives all and
who knows all, whose brooding consists of knowledge, from him is
born that Brahman, name and form and food.'</p>
<p>The argumentation of the S&acirc;@nkhyas that the pradh&acirc;na
may be called all-knowing on account of knowledge constituting an
attribute of the gu<i>n</i>a Goodness is inadmissible. For as in
the pradh&acirc;na-condition the three gu<i>n</i>as are in a state
of equipoise, knowledge which is a quality of Goodness only is not
possible<a id="footnotetag91" name="footnotetag91"></a><a href=
"#footnote91"><sup>91</sup></a>. Nor can we admit the explanation
that the pradh&acirc;na is all-knowing because endowed with the
capacity for all knowledge. For if, in the condition of equipoise
of the gu<i>n</i>as, we term the pradh&acirc;na all-knowing with
reference to the power of knowledge residing in Goodness, we must
likewise term it little-knowing, with reference to the power
impeding knowledge which resides in Passion and Darkness.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>{49}</span>
<p>Moreover a modification of Goodness which is not connected with
a witnessing (observing) principle (s&acirc;kshin) is not called
knowledge, and the non-intelligent pradh&acirc;na is destitute of
such a principle. It is therefore impossible to ascribe to the
pradh&acirc;na all-knowingness. The case of the Yogins finally does
not apply to the point under consideration; for as they possess
intelligence, they may, owing to an excess of Goodness in their
nature, rise to omniscience<a id="footnotetag92" name=
"footnotetag92"></a><a href=
"#footnote92"><sup>92</sup></a>.&mdash;Well then (say those
S&acirc;@nkhyas who believe in the existence of a Lord) let us
assume that the pradh&acirc;na possesses the quality of knowledge
owing to the witnessing principle (the Lord), just as the quality
of burning is imparted to an iron ball by fire.&mdash;No, we reply;
for if this were so, it would be more reasonable to assume that
that which is the cause of the pradh&acirc;na having the quality of
thought i.e. the all-knowing primary Brahman itself is the cause of
the world.</p>
<p>The objection that to Brahman also all-knowingness in its
primary sense cannot be ascribed because, if the activity of
cognition were permanent, Brahman could not be considered as
independent with regard to it, we refute as follows. In what way,
we ask the S&acirc;@nkhya, is Brahman's all-knowingness interfered
with by a permanent cognitional activity? To maintain that he, who
possesses eternal knowledge capable to throw light on all objects,
is not all-knowing, is contradictory. If his knowledge were
considered non-permanent, he would know sometimes, and sometimes he
would not know; from which it would follow indeed that he is not
all-knowing. This fault is however avoided if we admit Brahman's
knowledge to be permanent.&mdash;But, it may be objected, on this
latter alternative the knower cannot be designated as independent
with reference to the act of knowing.&mdash;Why not? we reply; the
sun also, although his heat and light are permanent, is
nevertheless designated as independent <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>{50}</span> when we say,
'he burns, he gives light<a id="footnotetag93" name=
"footnotetag93"></a><a href=
"#footnote93"><sup>93</sup></a>.'&mdash;But, it will again be
objected, we say that the sun burns or gives light when he stands
in relation to some object to be heated or illuminated; Brahman, on
the other hand, stands, before the creation of the world, in no
relation to any object of knowledge. The cases are therefore not
parallel.&mdash;This objection too, we reply, is not valid; for as
a matter of fact we speak of the Sun as an agent, saying 'the sun
shines' even without reference to any object illuminated by him,
and hence Brahman also may be spoken of as an agent, in such
passages as 'it thought,' &amp;c., even without reference to any
object of knowledge. If, however, an object is supposed to be
required ('knowing' being a transitive verb while 'shining' is
intransitive), the texts ascribing thought to Brahman will fit all
the better.&mdash;What then is that object to which the knowledge
of the Lord can refer previously to the origin of the
world?&mdash;Name and form, we reply, which can be defined neither
as being identical with Brahman nor as different from it, unevolved
but about to be evolved. For if, as the adherents of the
Yoga-<i>s</i>&acirc;stra assume, the Yogins have a perceptive
knowledge of the past and the future through the favour of the
Lord; in what terms shall we have to speak of the eternal cognition
of the ever pure Lord himself, whose objects are the creation,
subsistence, and dissolution of the world! The objection that
Brahman, previously to the origin of the world, is not able to
think because it is not connected with a body, &amp;c. does not
apply; for Brahman, whose nature is eternal cognition&mdash;as the
sun's nature is eternal luminousness&mdash;can <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>{51}</span> impossibly
stand in need of any instruments of knowledge. The transmigrating
soul (sa<i>m</i>s&acirc;rin) indeed, which is under the sway of
Nescience, &amp;c., may require a body in order that knowledge may
arise in it; but not so the Lord, who is free from all impediments
of knowledge. The two following Mantras also declare that the Lord
does not require a body, and that his knowledge is without any
obstructions. 'There is no effect and no instrument known of him,
no one is seen like unto him or better; his high power is revealed
as manifold, as inherent, acting as knowledge and force.' 'Grasping
without hands, hasting without feet, he sees without eyes, he hears
without ears. He knows what can be known, but no one knows him;
they call him the first, the great person' (<i>S</i>v. Up. VI, 8;
III, 19).</p>
<p>But, to raise a new objection, there exists no transmigrating
soul different from the Lord and obstructed by impediments of
knowledge; for <i>S</i>ruti expressly declares that 'there is no
other seer but he; there is no other knower but he' (B<i>ri</i>.
Up. III, 7, 23). How then can it be said that the origination of
knowledge in the transmigrating soul depends on a body, while it
does not do so in the case of the Lord?&mdash;True, we reply. There
is in reality no transmigrating soul different from the Lord. Still
the connexion (of the Lord) with limiting adjuncts, consisting of
bodies and so on, is assumed, just as we assume the ether to enter
into connexion with divers limiting adjuncts such as jars, pots,
caves, and the like. And just as in consequence of connexion of the
latter kind such conceptions and terms as 'the hollow (space) of a
jar,' &amp;c. are generally current, although the space inside a
jar is not really different from universal space, and just as in
consequence thereof there generally prevails the false notion that
there are different spaces such as the space of a jar and so on; so
there prevails likewise the false notion that the Lord and the
transmigrating soul are different; a notion due to the
non-discrimination of the (unreal) connexion of the soul with the
limiting conditions, consisting of the body and so on. That the
Self, although in reality the only existence, imparts the quality
of Selfhood to bodies and the like <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page52" id="page52"></a>{52}</span> which are Not-Self is a matter
of observation, and is due to mere wrong conception, which depends
in its turn on antecedent wrong conception. And the consequence of
the soul thus involving itself in the transmigratory state is that
its thought depends on a body and the like.</p>
<p>The averment that the pradh&acirc;na, because consisting of
several elements, can, like clay and similar substances, occupy the
place of a cause while the uncompounded Brahman cannot do so, is
refuted by the fact of the pradh&acirc;na not basing on Scripture.
That, moreover, it is possible to establish by argumentation the
causality of Brahman, but not of the pradh&acirc;na and similar
principles, the S&ucirc;trak&acirc;ra will set forth in the second
Adhy&acirc;ya (II, 1, 4, &amp;c.).</p>
<p>Here the S&acirc;@nkhya comes forward with a new objection. The
difficulty stated by you, he says, viz. that the non-intelligent
pradh&acirc;na cannot be the cause of the world, because thought is
ascribed to the latter in the sacred texts, can be got over in
another way also, viz. on the ground that non-intelligent things
are sometimes figuratively spoken of as intelligent beings. We
observe, for instance, that people say of a river-bank about to
fall, 'the bank is inclined to fall (pipatishati),' and thus speak
of a non-intelligent bank as if it possessed intelligence. So the
pradh&acirc;na also, although non-intelligent, may, when about to
create, be figuratively spoken of as thinking. Just as in ordinary
life some intelligent person after having bathed, and dined, and
formed the purpose of driving in the afternoon to his village,
necessarily acts according to his purpose, so the pradh&acirc;na
also acts by the necessity of its own nature, when transforming
itself into the so-called great principle and the subsequent forms
of evolution; it may therefore figuratively be spoken of as
intelligent.&mdash;But what reason have you for setting aside the
primary meaning of the word 'thought' and for taking it in a
figurative sense?&mdash;The observation, the S&acirc;@nkhya
replies, that fire and water also are figuratively spoken of as
intelligent beings in the two following scriptural passages, 'That
fire thought; that water thought' (Ch. Up. VI, 2, 3; 4). We
therefrom conclude that thought is to be taken in a figurative
sense there <span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id=
"page53"></a>{53}</span> also where Being (Sat) is the agent,
because it is mentioned in a chapter where (thought) is generally
taken in a figurative sense<a id="footnotetag94" name=
"footnotetag94"></a><a href="#footnote94"><sup>94</sup></a>.</p>
<p>To this argumentation of the S&acirc;dkhya the next S&ucirc;tra
replies:</p>
<p>6. If it is said that (the word 'seeing') has a figurative
meaning, we deny that, on account of the word Self (being applied
to the cause of the world).</p>
<p>Your assertion that the term 'Being' denotes the non-intelligent
pradh&acirc;na, and that thought is ascribed to it in a figurative
sense only, as it is to fire and water, is untenable. Why so? On
account of the term 'Self.' For the passage Ch. Up. VI, 2, which
begins 'Being only, my dear, this was in the beginning,' after
having related the creation of fire, water, and earth ('it
thought,' &amp;c.; 'it sent forth fire,' &amp;c.), goes
on&mdash;denoting the thinking principle of which the whole chapter
treats, and likewise fire, water, and earth, by the
term&mdash;'divinities'&mdash;as follows, 'That divinity thought:
Let me now enter those three divinities with this living Self
(j&icirc;va. &acirc;tman) and evolve names and forms.' If we
assumed that in this passage the non-intelligent pradh&acirc;na is
figuratively spoken of as thinking, we should also have to assume
that the same pradh&acirc;na&mdash;as once constituting the
subject-matter of the chapter&mdash;is referred to by the term
'that divinity.' But in that case the divinity would not speak of
the j&icirc;va as 'Self.' For by the term 'J&icirc;va' we must
understand, according to the received meaning and the etymology of
the word, the intelligent (principle) which rules over the body and
sustains the vital airs. How could such a principle be the Self of
the non-intelligent pradh&acirc;na? By 'Self' we understand (a
being's) own nature, and it is clear that the intelligent
J&icirc;va cannot constitute the nature of the non-intelligent
pradh&acirc;na. If, on the other hand, we refer the whole chapter
to the intelligent Brahman, to <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page54" id="page54"></a>{54}</span> which thought in its primary
sense belongs, the use of the word 'Self' with reference to the
J&icirc;va is quite adequate. Then again there is the other
passage, 'That which is that subtle essence, in it all that exists
has its self. It is the true. It is the Self. That art thou, O
<i>S</i>vetaketu' (Ch. Up. VI, 8, 7, &amp;c.). Here the clause 'It
is the Self' designates the Being of which the entire chapter
treats, viz. the subtle Self, by the word 'Self,' and the
concluding clause, 'that art thou, O <i>S</i>vetaketu,' declares
the intelligent <i>S</i>vetaketu to be of the nature of the Self.
Fire and water, on the other hand, are non-intelligent, since they
are objects (of the mind), and since they are declared to be
implicated in the evolution of names and forms. And as at the same
time there is no reason for ascribing to them thought in its
primary sense&mdash;while the employment of the word 'Self'
furnishes such a reason with reference to the Sat&mdash;the thought
attributed to them must be explained in a figurative sense, like
the inclination of the river-bank. Moreover, the thinking on the
part of fire and water is to be understood as dependent on their
being ruled over by the Sat. On the other hand, the thought of the
Sat is, on account of the word 'Self,' not to be understood in a
figurative sense.<a id="footnotetag95" name=
"footnotetag95"></a><a href="#footnote95"><sup>95</sup></a></p>
<p>Here the S&acirc;@nkhya comes forward with a new objection. The
word 'Self,' he says, may be applied to the pradh&acirc;na,
although unintelligent, because it is sometimes figuratively used
in the sense of 'that which effects all purposes of another;' as,
for instance, a king applies the word 'Self' to some servant who
carries out all the king's intentions, 'Bhadrasena is my (other)
Self.' For the pradh&acirc;na, which effects the enjoyment and the
emancipation of the soul, serves the latter in the same way as a
minister serves his king in the affairs of peace and war. Or else,
it may be said, the one word 'Self' may refer to non-intelligent
things as well as to intelligent beings, as we see that such
expressions as 'the Self of the elements,' 'the Self of the
senses,' are made use of, and as the one word 'light' (jyotis)
denotes a certain <span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id=
"page55"></a>{55}</span> sacrifice (the jyotish<i>t</i>oma) as well
as a flame. How then does it follow from the word 'Self' that the
thinking (ascribed to the cause of the world) is not to be taken in
a figurative sense?</p>
<p>To this last argumentation the S&ucirc;trak&acirc;ra
replies:</p>
<p>7. (The pradh&acirc;na cannot be designated by the term 'Self')
because release is taught of him who takes his stand on that (the
Sat).</p>
<p>The non-intelligent pradh&acirc;na cannot be the object of the
term 'Self' because in the passage Ch. Up. VI, 2 ff., where the
subtle Sat which is under discussion is at first referred to in the
sentence, 'That is the Self,' and where the subsequent clause,
'That art thou, O <i>S</i>vetaketu,' declares the intelligent
<i>S</i>vetaketu to have his abode in the Self, a passage
subsequent to the two quoted (viz. 'a man who has a teacher obtains
true knowledge; for him there is only delay as long as he is not
delivered, then he will be perfect') declares final release. For if
the non-intelligent pradh&acirc;na were denoted by the term 'Sat'
and did comprehend&mdash;by means of the phrase 'That art
thou'&mdash;persons desirous of final release who as such are
intelligent, the meaning could only be 'Thou art non-intelligent;'
so that Scripture would virtually make contradictory statements to
the disadvantage of man, and would thus cease to be a means of
right knowledge. But to assume that the faultless
<i>s</i>&acirc;stra is not a means of right knowledge, would be
contrary to reason. And if the <i>s</i>&acirc;stra, considered as a
means of right knowledge, should point out to a man desirous of
release, but ignorant of the way to it, a non-intelligent Self as
the real Self, he would&mdash;comparable to the blind man who had
caught hold of the ox's tail<a id="footnotetag96" name=
"footnotetag96"></a><a href=
"#footnote96"><sup>96</sup></a>&mdash;cling to the view of that
being the Self, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id=
"page56"></a>{56}</span> and thus never be able to reach the real
Self different from the false Self pointed out to him; hence he
would be debarred from what constitutes man's good, and would incur
evil. We must therefore conclude that, just as the
<i>s</i>&acirc;stra teaches the agnihotra and similar performances
in their true nature as means for those who are desirous of the
heavenly world, so the passage 'that is the Self, that art thou, O
<i>S</i>vetaketu,' teaches the Self in its true nature also. Only
on that condition release for him whose thoughts are true can be
taught by means of the simile in which the person to be released is
compared to the man grasping the heated axe (Ch. Up. VI, 16). For
in the other case, if the doctrine of the Sat constituting the Self
had a secondary meaning only, the cognition founded on the passage
'that art thou' would be of the nature of a fanciful combination
only<a id="footnotetag97" name="footnotetag97"></a><a href=
"#footnote97"><sup>97</sup></a>, like the knowledge derived from
the passage, 'I am the hymn' (Ait. &Acirc;r. II, 1, 2, 6), and
would lead to a mere transitory reward; so that the simile quoted
could not convey the doctrine of release. Therefore the word 'Self'
is applied to the subtle Sat not in a merely figurative sense. In
the case of the faithful servant, on the other hand, the word
'Self' can&mdash;in such phrases as 'Bhadrasena is my
Self'&mdash;be taken in a figurative sense, because the difference
between master and servant is well established by perception.
Moreover, to assume that, because words are sometimes seen to be
used in figurative senses, a figurative sense may be resorted to in
the case of those things also for which words (i.e. Vedic words)
are the only means of knowledge, is altogether indefensible; for an
assumption of that nature would lead to a general want of
confidence. The assertion that the word 'Self' may (primarily)
signify what is non-intelligent as well as what is intelligent,
just as the word 'jyotis' signifies a certain sacrifice as well as
light, is inadmissible, because we have no right to attribute to
words a plurality of meanings. Hence (we rather assume that) the
word 'Self' in its primary meaning refers to what is intelligent
only and is then, by a figurative <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page57" id="page57"></a>{57}</span> attribution of intelligence,
applied to the elements and the like also; whence such phrases as
'the Self of the elements,' 'the Self of the senses.' And even if
we assume that the word 'Self' primarily signifies both classes of
beings, we are unable to settle in any special case which of the
two meanings the word has, unless we are aided either by the
general heading under which it stands, or some determinative
attributive word. But in the passage under discussion there is
nothing to determine that the word refers to something
non-intelligent, while, on the other hand, the Sat distinguished by
thought forms the general heading, and <i>S</i>vetaketu, i.e. a
being endowed with intelligence, is mentioned in close proximity.
That a non-intelligent Self does not agree with <i>S</i>vetaketu,
who possesses intelligence, we have already shown. All these
circumstances determine the object of the word 'Self' here to be
something intelligent. The word 'jyotis' does moreover not furnish
an appropriate example; for according to common use it has the
settled meaning of 'light' only, and is used in the sense of
sacrifice only on account of the arthav&acirc;da assuming a
similarity (of the sacrifice) to light.</p>
<p>A different explanation of the S&ucirc;tra is also possible. The
preceding S&ucirc;tra may be taken completely to refute all doubts
as to the word 'Self' having a figurative or double sense, and then
the present S&ucirc;tra is to be explained as containing an
independent reason, proving that the doctrine of the pradh&acirc;na
being the general cause is untenable.</p>
<p>Hence the non-intelligent pradh&acirc;na is not denoted by the
word 'Self.' This the teacher now proceeds to prove by an
additional reason.</p>
<p>8. And (the pradh&acirc;na cannot be denoted by the word 'Self')
because there is no statement of its having to be set aside.</p>
<p>If the pradh&acirc;na which is the Not-Self were denoted by the
term 'Being' (Sat), and if the passage 'That is the Self, that art
thou, O <i>S</i>vetaketu,' referred to the pradh&acirc;na; the
teacher whose wish it is to impart instruction about the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>{58}</span>
true Brahman would subsequently declare that the pradh&acirc;na is
to be set aside (and the true Brahman to be considered); for
otherwise his pupil, having received the instruction about the
pradh&acirc;na, might take his stand on the latter, looking upon it
as the Non-Self. In ordinary life a man who wishes to point out to
a friend the (small) star Arundhat&icirc; at first directs his
attention to a big neighbouring star, saying 'that is
Arundhat&icirc;,' although it is really not so; and thereupon he
withdraws his first statement and points out the real
Arundhat&icirc;. Analogously the teacher (if he intended to make
his pupil understand the Self through the Non-Self) would in the
end definitely state that the Self is not of the nature of the
pradh&acirc;na. But no such statement is made; for the sixth
Prap&acirc;<i>th</i>aka arrives at a conclusion based on the view
that the Self is nothing but that which is (the Sat).</p>
<p>The word 'and' (in the S&ucirc;tra) is meant to notify that the
contradiction of a previous statement (which would be implied in
the rejected interpretation) is an additional reason for the
rejection. Such a contradiction would result even if it were stated
that the pradh&acirc;na is to be set aside. For in the beginning of
the Prap&acirc;<i>th</i>aka it is intimated that through the
knowledge of the cause everything becomes known. Compare the
following consecutive sentences, 'Have you ever asked for that
instruction by which we hear what cannot be heard, by which we
perceive what cannot be perceived, by which we know what cannot be
known? What is that instruction? As, my dear, by one clod of clay
all that is made of clay is known, the modification (i.e. the
effect) being a name merely which has its origin in speech, while
the truth is that it is clay merely,' &amp;c. Now if the term 'Sat'
denoted the pradh&acirc;na, which is merely the cause of the
aggregate of the objects of enjoyment, its knowledge, whether to be
set aside or not to be set aside, could never lead to the knowledge
of the aggregate of enjoyers (souls), because the latter is not an
effect of the pradh&acirc;na. Therefore the pradh&acirc;na is not
denoted by the term 'Sat.'&mdash;For this the S&ucirc;trak&acirc;ra
gives a further reason.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>{59}</span>
<p>9. On account of (the individual Soul) going to the Self (the
Self cannot be the pradh&acirc;na).</p>
<p>With reference to the cause denoted by the word 'Sat,' Scripture
says, 'When a man sleeps here, then, my dear, he becomes united
with the Sat, he is gone to his own (Self). Therefore they say of
him, "he sleeps" (svapiti), because he is gone to his own (svam
ap&icirc;ta).' (Ch. Up. VI, 8, 1.) This passage explains the
well-known verb 'to sleep,' with reference to the soul. The word,
'his own,' denotes the Self which had before been denoted by the
word Sat; to the Self he (the individual soul) goes, i.e. into it
it is resolved, according to the acknowledged sense of api-i, which
means 'to be resolved into.' The individual soul (j&icirc;va) is
called awake as long as being connected with the various external
objects by means of the modifications of the mind&mdash;which thus
constitute limiting adjuncts of the soul&mdash;it apprehends those
external objects, and identifies itself with the gross body, which
is one of those external objects<a id="footnotetag98" name=
"footnotetag98"></a><a href="#footnote98"><sup>98</sup></a>. When,
modified by the impressions which the external objects have left,
it sees dreams, it is denoted by the term 'mind<a id=
"footnotetag99" name="footnotetag99"></a><a href=
"#footnote99"><sup>99</sup></a>.' When, on the cessation of the two
limiting adjuncts (i.e. the subtle and the gross bodies), and the
consequent absence of the modifications due to the adjuncts, it is,
in the state of deep sleep, merged in the Self as it were, then it
is said to be asleep (resolved into the Self). A similar etymology
of the word 'h<i>ri</i>daya' is given by <i>s</i>ruti, 'That Self
abides in the heart. And this is the etymological explanation: he
is in the heart (h<i>ri</i>di ayam).' (Ch. Up. VIII, 3, 3.) The
words a<i>s</i>an&acirc;ya and udany&acirc; are similarly
etymologised: 'water is carrying away what has been eaten by him;'
'fire carries away what has been drunk by him' (Ch. Up. VI, 8, 3;
5). Thus the passage quoted above explains the resolution (of the
soul) into the Self, denoted by the term 'Sat,' by means of the
etymology of the word 'sleep.' But the intelligent <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>{60}</span> Self can
clearly not resolve itself into the non-intelligent pradh&acirc;na.
If, again, it were said that the pradh&acirc;na is denoted by the
word 'own,' because belonging to the Self (as being the Self's
own), there would remain the same absurd statement as to an
intelligent entity being resolved into a non-intelligent one.
Moreover another scriptural passage (viz. 'embraced by the
intelligent&mdash;praj<i>&ntilde;</i>a&mdash;Self he knows nothing
that is without, nothing that is within,' B<i>ri</i>. Up. IV, 3,
21) declares that the soul in the condition of dreamless sleep is
resolved into an intelligent entity. Hence that into which all
intelligent souls are resolved is an intelligent cause of the
world, denoted by the word 'Sat,' and not the
pradh&acirc;na.&mdash;A further reason for the pradh&acirc;na not
being the cause is subjoined.</p>
<p>10. On account of the uniformity of view (of the
Ved&acirc;nta-texts, Brahman is to be considered the cause).</p>
<p>If, as in the argumentations of the logicians, so in the
Ved&acirc;nta-texts also, there were set forth different views
concerning the nature of the cause, some of them favouring the
theory of an intelligent Brahman being the cause of the world,
others inclining towards the pradh&acirc;na doctrine, and others
again tending in a different direction; then it might perhaps be
possible to interpret such passages as those, which speak of the
cause of the world as thinking, in such a manner as to make them
fall in with the pradh&acirc;na theory. But the stated condition is
absent since all the Ved&acirc;nta-texts uniformly teach that the
cause of the world is the intelligent Brahman. Compare, for
instance, 'As from a burning fire sparks proceed in all directions,
thus from that Self the pr&acirc;<i>n</i>as proceed each towards
its place; from the pr&acirc;<i>n</i>as the gods, from the gods the
worlds' (Kau. Up. III, 3). And 'from that Self sprang ether'
(Taitt. Up. II, 1). And 'all this springs from the Self' (Ch. Up.
VII, 26, 1). And 'this pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a is born from the Self'
(Pr. Up. III, 3); all which passages declare the Self to be the
cause. That the word 'Self' denotes an intelligent being, we have
already shown.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>{61}</span>
<p>And that all the Ved&acirc;nta-texts advocate the same view as
to an intelligent cause of the world, greatly strengthens their
claim to be considered a means of right knowledge, just as the
corresponding claims of the senses are strengthened by their giving
us information of a uniform character regarding colour and the
like. The all-knowing Brahman is therefore to be considered the
cause of the world, 'on account of the uniformity of view (of the
Ved&acirc;nta-texts).'&mdash;A further reason for this conclusion
is advanced.</p>
<p>11. And because it is directly stated in Scripture (therefore
the all-knowing Brahman is the cause of the world).</p>
<p>That the all-knowing Lord is the cause of the world, is also
declared in a text directly referring to him (viz. the all-knowing
one), viz. in the following passage of the mantropanishad of the
<i>S</i>vet&acirc;<i>s</i>vataras (VI, 9) where the word 'he'
refers to the previously mentioned all-knowing Lord, 'He is the
cause, the lord of the lords of the organs, and there is of him
neither parent nor lord.' It is therefore finally settled that the
all-knowing Brahman is the general cause, not the non-intelligent
pradh&acirc;na or anything else.</p>
<p>In what precedes we have shown, availing ourselves of
appropriate arguments, that the Ved&acirc;nta-texts exhibited under
S&ucirc;tras I, 1-11, are capable of proving that the all-knowing,
all-powerful Lord is the cause of the origin, subsistence, and
dissolution of the world. And we have explained, by pointing to the
prevailing uniformity of view (I, 10), that all Ved&acirc;nta-texts
whatever maintain an intelligent cause. The question might
therefore be asked, 'What reason is there for the subsequent part
of the Ved&acirc;nta-s&ucirc;tras?' (as the chief point is settled
already.)</p>
<p>To this question we reply as follows: Brahman is apprehended
under two forms; in the first place as qualified by limiting
conditions owing to the multiformity of the evolutions of name and
form (i.e. the multiformity of the created world); in the second
place as being the opposite of this, i.e. free from all limiting
conditions whatever. Compare <span class="pagenum"><a name="page62"
id="page62"></a>{62}</span> the following passages: B<i>ri</i>. Up.
IV, 5, 15, 'For where there is duality as it were, then one sees
the other; but when the Self only is all this, how should he see
another?' Ch. Up. VII, 24, 1, 'Where one sees nothing else, hears
nothing else, understands nothing else, that is the greatest. Where
one sees something else, hears something else, understands
something else, that is the little. The greatest is immortal; the
little is mortal;' Taitt. Up. III, 12, 7, 'The wise one, who having
produced all forms and made all names, sits calling (the things by
their names<a id="footnotetag100" name=
"footnotetag100"></a><a href="#footnote100"><sup>100</sup></a>);'
<i>S</i>v. Up. VI, 19, 'Who is without parts, without actions,
tranquil, without faults, without taint, the highest bridge of
immortality, like a fire that has consumed its fuel;' B<i>ri</i>.
Up. II, 3, 6, 'Not so, not so;' B<i>ri</i>. Up. III, 8, 8, 'It is
neither coarse nor fine, neither short nor long;' and 'defective is
one place, perfect the other.' All these passages, with many
others, declare Brahman to possess a double nature, according as it
is the object either of Knowledge or of Nescience. As long as it is
the object of Nescience, there are applied to it the categories of
devotee, object of devotion, and the like<a id="footnotetag101"
name="footnotetag101"></a><a href=
"#footnote101"><sup>101</sup></a>. The different modes of devotion
lead to different results, some to exaltation, some to gradual
emancipation, some to success in works; those modes are distinct on
account of the distinction of the different qualities and limiting
conditions<a id="footnotetag102" name="footnotetag102"></a><a href=
"#footnote102"><sup>102</sup></a>. And although the one highest
Self only, i.e. the Lord distinguished by those different qualities
constitutes the object of devotion, still the fruits (of devotion)
are distinct, according as the devotion refers to different
qualities. Thus Scripture says, 'According as man worships him,
that he becomes;' and, 'According to what his thought is in this
world, so will he be when he has departed <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>{63}</span> this life'
(Ch. Up. III, 14, 1). Sm<i>ri</i>ti also makes an analogous
statement, 'Remembering whatever form of being he leaves this body
in the end, into that form he enters, being impressed with it
through his constant meditation' (Bha. G&icirc;t&acirc; VIII,
6).</p>
<p>Although one and the same Self is hidden in all beings movable
as well as immovable, yet owing to the gradual rise of excellence
of the minds which form the limiting conditions (of the Self),
Scripture declares that the Self, although eternally unchanging and
uniform, reveals itself<a id="footnotetag103" name=
"footnotetag103"></a><a href="#footnote103"><sup>103</sup></a> in a
graduated series of beings, and so appears in forms of various
dignity and power; compare, for instance (Ait. &Acirc;r. II, 3, 2,
1), 'He who knows the higher manifestation of the Self in him<a id=
"footnotetag104" name="footnotetag104"></a><a href=
"#footnote104"><sup>104</sup></a>,' &amp;c. Similarly Sm<i>ri</i>ti
remarks, 'Whatever being there is of power, splendour or might,
know it to have sprung from portions of my glory' (Bha.
G&icirc;t&acirc;, X, 41); a passage declaring that wherever there
is an excess of power and so on, there the Lord is to be
worshipped. Accordingly here (i.e. in the S&ucirc;tras) also the
teacher will show that the golden person in the disc of the Sun is
the highest Self, on account of an indicating sign, viz. the
circumstance of his being unconnected with any evil (Ved. S&ucirc;.
I, 1, 20); the same is to be observed with regard to I, 1, 22 and
other S&ucirc;tras. And, again, an enquiry will have to be
undertaken into the meaning of the texts, in order that a settled
conclusion may be reached concerning that knowledge of the Self
which leads to instantaneous release; for although that knowledge
is conveyed by means of various limiting conditions, yet no special
connexion with limiting conditions is intended to be intimated, in
consequence of which there arises a doubt whether it (the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>{64}</span>
knowledge) has the higher or the lower Brahman for its object; so,
for instance, in the case of S&ucirc;tra I, 1, 12<a id=
"footnotetag105" name="footnotetag105"></a><a href=
"#footnote105"><sup>105</sup></a>. From all this it appears that
the following part of the <i>S</i>&acirc;stra has a special object
of its own, viz. to show that the Ved&acirc;nta-texts teach, on the
one hand, Brahman as connected with limiting conditions and forming
an object of devotion, and on the other hand, as being free from
the connexion with such conditions and constituting an object of
knowledge. The refutation, moreover, of non-intelligent causes
different from Brahman, which in I, 1, 10 was based on the
uniformity of the meaning of the Ved&acirc;nta-texts, will be
further detailed by the S&ucirc;trak&acirc;ra, who, while
explaining additional passages relating to Brahman, will preclude
all causes of a nature opposite to that of Brahman.</p>
<p>12. (The Self) consisting of bliss (is the highest Self) on
account of the repetition (of the word 'bliss,' as denoting the
highest Self).</p>
<p>The Taittir&icirc;ya-upanishad (II, 1-5), after having
enumerated the Self consisting of food, the Self consisting of the
vital airs, the Self consisting of mind, and the Self consisting of
understanding, says, 'Different from this which consists of
understanding is the other inner Self which consists of bliss.'
Here the doubt arises whether the phrase, 'that which consists of
bliss,' denotes the highest Brahman of which it had been said
previously, that 'It is true Being, Knowledge, without end,' or
something different from Brahman, just as the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>{65}</span> Self
consisting of food, &amp;c., is different from it.&mdash;The
p&ucirc;rvapakshin maintains that the Self consisting of bliss is a
secondary (not the principal) Self, and something different from
Brahman; as it forms a link in a series of Selfs, beginning with
the Self consisting of food, which all are not the principal Self.
To the objection that even thus the Self consisting of bliss may be
considered as the primary Self, since it is stated to be the
innermost of all, he replies that this cannot be admitted, because
the Self of bliss is declared to have joy and so on for its limbs,
and because it is said to be embodied. If it were identical with
the primary Self, joy and the like would not touch it; but the text
expressly says 'Joy is its head;' and about its being embodied we
read, 'Of that former one this one is the embodied Self' (Taitt.
Up. II, 6), i.e. of that former Self of Understanding this Self of
bliss is the embodied Self. And of what is embodied, the contact
with joy and pain cannot be prevented. Therefore the Self which
consists of bliss is nothing but the transmigrating Soul.</p>
<p>To this reasoning we make the following reply:&mdash;By the Self
consisting of bliss we have to understand the highest Self, 'on
account of repetition.' For the word 'bliss' is repeatedly applied
to the highest Self. So Taitt. Up. II, 7, where, after the clause
'That is flavour'&mdash;which refers back to the Self consisting of
bliss, and declares it to be of the nature of flavour&mdash;we
read, 'For only after having perceived flavour can any one perceive
delight. Who could breathe, who could breathe forth if that Bliss
existed not in the ether (of the heart)? For he alone causes
blessedness;' and again, II, 8, 'Now this is an examination of
Bliss;' 'He reaches that Self consisting of Bliss;' and again, II,
9, 'He who knows the Bliss of Brahman fears nothing;' and in
addition, 'He understood that Bliss is Brahman' (III, 6). And in
another scriptural passage also (B<i>ri</i>. Up. III, 9, 28),
'Knowledge and bliss is Brahman,' we see the word 'bliss' applied
just to Brahman. As, therefore, the word 'bliss' is repeatedly used
with reference to Brahman, we conclude that the Self consisting of
bliss is Brahman also. The objection that the Self consisting of
bliss can only denote <span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id=
"page66"></a>{66}</span> the secondary Self (the
Sa<i>m</i>s&acirc;rin), because it forms a link in a series of
secondary Selfs, beginning with the one consisting of food, is of
no force, for the reason that the Self consisting of bliss is the
innermost of all. The <i>S</i>&acirc;stra, wishing to convey
information about the primary Self, adapts itself to common
notions, in so far as it at first refers to the body consisting of
food, which, although not the Self, is by very obtuse people
identified with it; it then proceeds from the body to another Self,
which has the same shape with the preceding one, just as the statue
possesses the form of the mould into which the molten brass had
been poured; then, again, to another one, always at first
representing the Non-Self as the Self, for the purpose of easier
comprehension; and it finally teaches that the innermost Self<a id=
"footnotetag106" name="footnotetag106"></a><a href=
"#footnote106"><sup>106</sup></a>, which consists of bliss, is the
real Self. Just as when a man, desirous of pointing out the star
Arundhat&icirc; to another man, at first points to several stars
which are not Arundhat&icirc; as being Arundhat&icirc;, while only
the star pointed out in the end is the real Arundhat&icirc;; so
here also the Self consisting of bliss is the real Self on account
of its being the innermost (i.e. the last). Nor can any weight be
allowed to the objection that the attribution of joy and so on, as
head, &amp;c., cannot possibly refer to the real Self; for this
attribution is due to the immediately preceding limiting condition
(viz. the Self consisting of understanding, the so-called
vij<i>&ntilde;</i>&acirc;nakosa), and does not really belong to the
real Self. The possession of a bodily nature also is ascribed to
the Self of bliss, only because it is represented as a link in the
chain of bodies which begins with the Self consisting of food, and
is not ascribed to it in the same direct sense in which it is
predicated of the transmigrating Self. Hence the Self consisting of
bliss is the highest Brahman.</p>
<p>13. If (it be objected that the term &acirc;nandamaya,
consisting of bliss, can) not (denote the highest Self) on account
of its being a word denoting a modification <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>{67}</span> (or
product); (we declare the objection to be) not (valid) on account
of abundance, (the idea of which may be expressed by the affix
maya.)</p>
<p>Here the p&ucirc;rvapakshin raises the objection that the word
&acirc;nandamaya (consisting of bliss) cannot denote the highest
Self.&mdash;Why?&mdash;Because the word &acirc;nandamaya is
understood to denote something different from the original word
(i.e. the word &acirc;nanda without the derivative affix maya),
viz. a modification; according to the received sense of the affix
maya. '&Acirc;nandamaya' therefore denotes a modification, just as
annamaya (consisting of food) and similar words do.</p>
<p>This objection is, however, not valid, because 'maya' is also
used in the sense of abundance, i.e. denotes that where there is
abundance of what the original word expresses. So, for instance,
the phrase 'the sacrifice is annamaya' means 'the sacrifice is
abounding in food' (not 'is some modification or product of food').
Thus here Brahman also, as abounding in bliss, is called
&acirc;nandamaya. That Brahman does abound in bliss follows from
the passage (Taitt. Up. II, 8), where, after the bliss of each of
the different classes of beings, beginning with man, has been
declared to be a hundred times greater than the bliss of the
immediately preceding class, the bliss of Brahman is finally
proclaimed to be absolutely supreme. Maya therefore denotes
abundance.</p>
<p>14. And because he is declared to be the cause of it, (i.e. of
bliss; therefore maya is to be taken as denoting abundance.)</p>
<p>Maya must be understood to denote abundance, for that reason
also that Scripture declares Brahman to be the cause of bliss, 'For
he alone causes bliss' (Taitt. Up. II, 7). For he who causes bliss
must himself abound in bliss; just as we infer in ordinary life,
that a man who enriches others must himself possess abundant
wealth. As, therefore, maya may be taken to mean 'abundant,' the
Self consisting of bliss is the highest Self.</p>
<p>15. Moreover (the &acirc;nandamaya is Brahman because)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>{68}</span>
the same (Brahman) which had been referred to in the mantra is
sung, (i.e. proclaimed in the Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a passage as the
&acirc;nandamaya.)</p>
<p>The Self, consisting of joy, is the highest Brahman for the
following reason also<a id="footnotetag107" name=
"footnotetag107"></a><a href="#footnote107"><sup>107</sup></a>. On
the introductory words 'he who knows Brahman attains the highest'
(Taitt. Up. II, 1), there follows a mantra proclaiming that
Brahman, which forms the general topic of the chapter, possesses
the qualities of true existence, intelligence, infinity; after that
it is said that from Brahman there sprang at first the ether and
then all other moving and non-moving things, and that, entering
into the beings which it had emitted, Brahman stays in the recess,
inmost of all; thereupon, for its better comprehension, the series
of the different Selfs ('different from this is the inner Self,'
&amp;c.) are enumerated, and then finally the same Brahman which
the mantra had proclaimed, is again proclaimed in the passage under
discussion, 'different from this is the other inner Self, which
consists of bliss.' To assume that a mantra and the
Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a passage belonging to it have the same sense
is only proper, on account of the absence of contradiction (which
results therefrom); for otherwise we should be driven to the
unwelcome inference that the text drops the topic once started, and
turns to an altogether new subject.</p>
<p>Nor is there mentioned a further inner Self different from the
Self consisting of bliss, as in the case of the Self consisting of
food, &amp;c.<a id="footnotetag108" name=
"footnotetag108"></a><a href="#footnote108"><sup>108</sup></a> On
the same (i.e. the Self consisting of bliss) is founded, 'This same
knowledge of Bh<i>ri</i>gu and Varu<i>n</i>a; he understood that
bliss is Brahman' (Taitt. Up. III, 6). Therefore the Self
consisting of bliss is the highest Self.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>{69}</span>
<p>16. (The Self consisting of bliss is the highest Self,) not the
other (i.e. the individual Soul), on account of the impossibility
(of the latter assumption).</p>
<p>And for the following reason also the Self consisting of bliss
is the highest Self only, not the other, i.e. the one which is
other than the Lord, i.e. the transmigrating individual soul. The
personal soul cannot be denoted by the term 'the one consisting of
bliss.' Why? On account of the impossibility. For Scripture says,
with reference to the Self consisting of bliss, 'He wished, may I
be many, may I grow forth. He brooded over himself. After he had
thus brooded, he sent forth whatever there is.' Here, the desire
arising before the origination of a body, &amp;c., the
non-separation of the effects created from the creator, and the
creation of all effects whatever, cannot possibly belong to any
Self different from the highest Self.</p>
<p>17. And on account of the declaration of the difference (of the
two, the &acirc;nandamaya cannot be the transmigrating soul).</p>
<p>The Self consisting of bliss cannot be identical with the
transmigrating soul, for that reason also that in the section
treating of the Self of bliss, the individual soul and the Self of
bliss are distinctly represented as different; Taitt. Up. II, 7,
'It (i.e. the Self consisting of bliss) is a flavour; for only
after perceiving a flavour can this (soul) perceive bliss.' For he
who perceives cannot be that which is perceived.&mdash;But, it may
be asked, if he who perceives or attains cannot be that which is
perceived or attained, how about the following <i>S</i>ruti- and
Smr<i>ri</i>ti-passages, 'The Self is to be sought;' 'Nothing
higher is known than the attainment of the Self<a id=
"footnotetag109" name="footnotetag109"></a><a href=
"#footnote109"><sup>109</sup></a>?'&mdash;This objection, we reply,
is legitimate (from the point of view of absolute truth). Yet we
see that in ordinary life, the Self, which in reality is never
anything <span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id=
"page70"></a>{70}</span> but the Self, is, owing to
non-comprehension of the truth, identified with the Non-Self, i.e.
the body and so on; whereby it becomes possible to speak of the
Self in so far as it is identified with the body, and so on, as
something not searched for but to be searched for, not heard but to
be heard, not seized but to be seized, not perceived but to be
perceived, not known but to be known, and the like. Scripture, on
the other hand, denies, in such passages as 'there is no other seer
but he' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. III, 7, 23), that there is in reality any
seer or hearer different from the all-knowing highest Lord. (Nor
can it be said that the Lord is unreal because he is identical with
the unreal individual soul; for)<a id="footnotetag110" name=
"footnotetag110"></a><a href="#footnote110"><sup>110</sup></a> the
Lord differs from the soul (vij<i>&ntilde;</i>&acirc;n&acirc;tman)
which is embodied, acts and enjoys, and is the product of
Nescience, in the same way as the real juggler who stands on the
ground differs from the illusive juggler, who, holding in his hand
a shield and a sword, climbs up to the sky by means of a rope; or
as the free unlimited ether differs from the ether of a jar, which
is determined by its limiting adjunct, (viz. the jar.) With
reference to this fictitious difference of the highest Self and the
individual Self, the two last S&ucirc;tras have been
propounded.</p>
<p>18. And on account of desire (being mentioned as belonging to
the &acirc;nandamaya) no regard is to be had to what is inferred,
(i.e. to the pradh&acirc;na inferred by the S&acirc;@nkhyas.)</p>
<p>Since in the passage 'he desired, may I be many, may I grow
forth,' which occurs in the chapter treating of the
&acirc;nandamaya (Taitt. Up. II, 6), the quality of feeling desire
is mentioned, that which is inferred, i.e. the non-intelligent
pradh&acirc;na assumed by the S&acirc;@nkhyas, cannot be regarded
as being the Self consisting of bliss and the cause of the world.
Although the opinion that the pradh&acirc;na is the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>{71}</span> cause of the
world, has already been refuted in the S&ucirc;tra I, 1, 5, it is
here, where a favourable opportunity presents itself, refuted for a
second time on the basis of the scriptural passage about the cause
of the world feeling desire, for the purpose of showing the
uniformity of view (of all scriptural passages).</p>
<p>19. And, moreover, it (i.e. Scripture) teaches the joining of
this (i.e. the individual soul) with that, (i.e. the Self
consisting of bliss), on that (being fully known).</p>
<p>And for the following reason also the term, 'the Self consisting
of bliss,' cannot denote either the pradh&acirc;na or the
individual soul. Scripture teaches that the individual soul when it
has reached knowledge is joined, i.e. identified, with the Self of
bliss under discussion, i.e. obtains final release. Compare the
following passage (Taitt. Up. II, 7), 'When he finds freedom from
fear, and rest in that which is invisible, incorporeal, undefined,
unsupported, then he has obtained the fearless. For if he makes but
the smallest distinction in it there is fear for him.' That means,
if he sees in that Self consisting of bliss even a small difference
in the form of non-identity, then he finds no release from the fear
of transmigratory existence. But when he, by means of the cognition
of absolute identity, finds absolute rest in the Self consisting of
bliss, then he is freed from the fear of transmigratory existence.
But this (finding absolute rest) is possible only when we
understand by the Self consisting of bliss, the highest Self, and
not either the pradh&acirc;na or the individual soul. Hence it is
proved that the Self consisting of bliss is the highest Self.</p>
<p>But, in reality, the following remarks have to be made
concerning the true meaning of the word '&acirc;nandamaya<a id=
"footnotetag111" name="footnotetag111"></a><a href=
"#footnote111"><sup>111</sup></a>.' On what grounds, we ask, can it
be maintained that the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id=
"page72"></a>{72}</span> affix 'maya' after having, in the series
of compounds beginning with annamaya and ending with
vij<i>&ntilde;</i>&acirc;namaya, denoted mere modifications, should
all at once, in the word &acirc;nandamaya, which belongs to the
same series, denote abundance, so that &acirc;nandamaya would refer
to Brahman? If it should be said that the assumption is made on
account of the governing influence of the Brahman proclaimed in the
mantra (which forms the beginning of the chapter, Taitt. Up. II),
we reply that therefrom it would follow that also the Selfs
consisting of food, breath, &amp;c., denote Brahman (because the
governing influence of the mantra extends to them also).&mdash;The
advocate of the former interpretation will here, perhaps, restate
an argument already made use of above, viz. as follows: To assume
that the Selfs consisting of food, and so on, are not Brahman is
quite proper, because after each of them an inner Self is
mentioned. After the Self of bliss, on the other hand, no further
inner Self is mentioned, and hence it must be considered to be
Brahman itself; otherwise we should commit the mistake of dropping
the subject-matter in hand (as which Brahman is pointed out by the
mantra), and taking up a new topic.&mdash;But to this we reply
that, although unlike the case of the Selfs consisting of food,
&amp;c., no inner Self is mentioned after the Self consisting of
bliss, still the latter cannot be considered as Brahman, because
with reference to the Self consisting of bliss Scripture declares,
'Joy is its head. Satisfaction is its right arm. Great satisfaction
is its left arm. Bliss is its trunk. Brahman is its tail, its
support.' Now, here the very same Brahman which, in the mantra, had
been introduced as the subject of the discussion, is called the
tail, the support; while the five involucra, extending from the
involucrum of food up to the involucrum of bliss, are merely
introduced for the purpose of setting forth the knowledge of
Brahman. How, then, can it be maintained that our interpretation
implies the needless dropping of the general subject-matter and the
introduction of a new topic?&mdash;But, it may again be objected,
Brahman is called the tail, i.e. a member of the Self consisting of
bliss; analogously to those passages in which a tail and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>{73}</span>
other members are ascribed to the Selfs consisting of food and so
on. On what grounds, then, can we claim to know that Brahman (which
is spoken of as a mere member, i.e. a subordinate matter) is in
reality the chief matter referred to?&mdash;From the fact, we
reply, of Brahman being the general subject-matter of the
chapter.&mdash;But, it will again be said, that interpretation also
according to which Brahman is cognised as a mere member of the
&acirc;nandamaya does not involve a dropping of the subject-matter,
since the &acirc;nandamaya himself is Brahman.&mdash;But, we reply,
in that case one and the same Brahman would at first appear as the
whole, viz. as the Self consisting of bliss, and thereupon as a
mere part, viz. as the tail; which is absurd. And as one of the two
alternatives must be preferred, it is certainly appropriate to
refer to Brahman the clause 'Brahman is the tail' which contains
the word 'Brahman,' and not the sentence about the Self of Bliss in
which Brahman is not mentioned. Moreover, Scripture, in
continuation of the phrase, 'Brahman is the tail, the support,'
goes on, 'On this there is also the following <i>s</i>loka: He who
knows the Brahman as non-existing becomes himself non-existing. He
who knows Brahman as existing him we know himself as existing.' As
this <i>s</i>loka, without any reference to the Self of bliss,
states the advantage and disadvantage connected with the knowledge
of the being and non-being of Brahman only, we conclude that the
clause, 'Brahman is the tail, the support,' represents Brahman as
the chief matter (not as a merely subordinate matter). About the
being or non-being of the Self of bliss, on the other hand, a doubt
is not well possible, since the Self of bliss distinguished by joy,
satisfaction, &amp;c., is well known to every one.&mdash;But if
Brahman is the principal matter, how can it be designated as the
mere tail of the Self of bliss ('Brahman is the tail, the
support')?&mdash;Its being called so, we reply, forms no objection;
for the word tail here denotes that which is of the nature of a
tail, so that we have to understand that the bliss of Brahman is
not a member (in its literal sense), but the support or abode, the
one nest (resting-place) of all worldly bliss. Analogously another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>{74}</span>
scriptural passage declares, 'All other creatures live on a small
portion of that bliss' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. IV, 3, 32). Further, if by
the Self consisting of bliss we were to understand Brahman we
should have to assume that the Brahman meant is the Brahman
distinguished by qualities (savi<i>s</i>esha), because it is said
to have joy and the like for its members. But this assumption is
contradicted by a complementary passage (II, 9) which declares that
Brahman is the object neither of mind nor speech, and so shows that
the Brahman meant is the (absolute) Brahman (devoid of qualities),
'From whence all speech, with the mind, turns away unable to reach
it, he who knows the bliss of that Brahman fears nothing.'
Moreover, if we speak of something as 'abounding in bliss<a id=
"footnotetag112" name="footnotetag112"></a><a href=
"#footnote112"><sup>112</sup></a>,' we thereby imply the
co-existence of pain; for the word 'abundance' in its ordinary
sense implies the existence of a small measure of what is opposed
to the thing whereof there is abundance. But the passage so
understood would be in conflict with another passage (Ch. Up. VII,
24), 'Where one sees nothing else, hears nothing else, understands
nothing else, that is the Infinite;' which declares that in the
Infinite, i.e. Brahman, there is nothing whatever different from
it. Moreover, as joy, &amp;c. differ in each individual body, the
Self consisting of bliss also is a different one in each body.
Brahman, on the other hand, does not differ according to bodies;
for the mantra at the beginning of the chapter declares it to be
true Being, knowledge, infinite, and another passage says, 'He is
the one God, hidden in all beings, all-pervading, the Self within
all beings' (<i>S</i>v. Up. VI, 11). Nor, again, does Scripture
exhibit a frequent repetition of the word '&acirc;nandamaya;' for
merely the radical part of the compound (i.e. the word &acirc;nanda
without the affix maya) is repeated in all the following passages;
'It is a flavour, for only after seizing flavour can any one seize
bliss. Who could breathe, who could breathe forth, if that bliss
existed not in the ether? For he alone causes blessedness;' 'Now
this is an examination of bliss;' 'He who <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>{75}</span> knows the
bliss of that Brahman fears nothing;' 'He understood that bliss is
Brahman.' If it were a settled matter that Brahman is denoted by
the term, 'the Self consisting of bliss,' then we could assume that
in the subsequent passages, where merely the word 'bliss' is
employed, the term 'consisting of bliss' is meant to be repeated;
but that the Self consisting of bliss is not Brahman, we have
already proved by means of the reason of joy being its head, and so
on. Hence, as in another scriptural passage, viz. 'Brahman is
knowledge and bliss' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. III, 9, 28), the mere word
'bliss' denotes Brahman, we must conclude that also in such
passages as, 'If that bliss existed not in the ether,' the word
bliss is used with reference to Brahman, and is not meant to repeat
the term 'consisting of bliss.' The repetition of the full
compound, 'consisting of bliss,' which occurs in the passage, 'He
reaches that Self consisting of bliss' (Taitt. Up. II, 8), does not
refer to Brahman, as it is contained in the enumeration of
Non-Selfs, comprising the Self of food, &amp;c., all of which are
mere effects, and all of which are represented as things to be
reached.&mdash;But, it may be said, if the Self consisting of
bliss, which is said to have to be reached, were not
Brahman&mdash;just as the Selfs consisting of food, &amp;c. are not
Brahman&mdash;then it would not be declared (in the passage
immediately following) that he who knows obtains for his reward
Brahman.&mdash;This objection we invalidate by the remark that the
text makes its declaration as to Brahman&mdash;which is the tail,
the support&mdash;being reached by him who knows, by the very means
of the declaration as to the attainment of the Self of bliss; as
appears from the passage, 'On this there is also this <i>s</i>loka,
from which all speech returns,' &amp;c. With reference, again, to
the passage, 'He desired: may I be many, may I grow forth,' which
is found in proximity to the mention of the Self consisting of
bliss, we remark that it is in reality connected (not with the Self
of bliss but with) Brahman, which is mentioned in the still nearer
passage, 'Brahman is the tail, the support,' and does therefore not
intimate that the Self of bliss is Brahman. And, on account of its
referring to the passage last quoted ('it desired,' &amp;c.), the
later passage <span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id=
"page76"></a>{76}</span> also, 'That is flavour,' &amp;c., has not
the Self of bliss for its subject.&mdash;But, it may be objected,
the (neuter word) Brahman cannot possibly be designated by a
masculine word as you maintain is done in the passage, 'He
desired,' &amp;c.&mdash;In reply to this objection we point to the
passage (Taitt. Up. II, 1), 'From that Self sprang ether,' where,
likewise, the masculine word 'Self' can refer to Brahman only,
since the latter is the general topic of the chapter. In the
knowledge of Bh<i>ri</i>gu and Varu<i>n</i>a finally ('he knew that
bliss is Brahman'), the word 'bliss' is rightly understood to
denote Brahman, since we there meet neither with the affix 'maya,'
nor with any statement as to joy being its head, and the like. To
ascribe to Brahman in itself joy, and so on, as its members, is
impossible, unless we have recourse to certain, however minute,
distinctions qualifying Brahman; and that the whole chapter is not
meant to convey a knowledge of the qualified (savi<i>s</i>esha)
Brahman is proved by the passage (quoted above), which declares
that Brahman transcends speech and mind. We therefore must conclude
that the affix maya, in the word &acirc;nandamaya, does not denote
abundance, but expresses a mere effect, just as it does in the
words annamaya and the subsequent similar compounds.</p>
<p>The S&ucirc;tras are therefore to be explained as follows. There
arises the question whether the passage, 'Brahman is the tail, the
support,' is to be understood as intimating that Brahman is a mere
member of the Self consisting of bliss, or that it is the principal
matter. If it is said that it must be considered as a mere member,
the reply is, 'The Self consisting of bliss on account of the
repetition.' That means: Brahman, which in the passage 'the Self
consisting of bliss,' &amp;c., is spoken of as the tail, the
support, is designated as the principal matter (not as something
subordinate). On account of the repetition; for in the memorial
<i>s</i>loka, 'he becomes himself non-existing,' Brahman alone is
reiterated. 'If not, on account of the word denoting a
modification; not so, on account of abundance.' In this S&ucirc;tra
the word 'modification' is meant to convey the sense of member. The
objection that on account of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page77"
id="page77"></a>{77}</span> the word 'tail,' which denotes a mere
member, Brahman cannot be taken as the principal matter must be
refuted. This we do by remarking that there is no difficulty, since
a word denoting a member may be introduced into the passage on
account of pr&acirc;<i>k</i>urya<a id="footnotetag113" name=
"footnotetag113"></a><a href="#footnote113"><sup>113</sup></a>.
Pr&acirc;<i>k</i>urya here means a phraseology abounding in terms
denoting members. After the different members, beginning with the
head and ending with the tail, of the Selfs, consisting of food,
&amp;c. have been enumerated, there are also mentioned the head and
the other limbs of the Self of bliss, and then it is added,
'Brahman is the tail, the support;' the intention being merely to
introduce some more terms denoting members, not to convey the
meaning of 'member,' (an explanation which is impossible) because
the preceding S&ucirc;tra already has proved Brahman (not to be a
member, but) to be the principal matter. 'And because he is
declared to be the cause of it.' That means: Brahman is declared to
be the cause of the entire aggregate of effects, inclusive of the
Self, consisting of bliss, in the following passage, 'He created
all whatever there is' (Taitt. Up. II, 6). And as Brahman is the
cause, it cannot at the same time be called the member, in the
literal sense of the word, of the Self of bliss, which is nothing
but one of Brahman's effects. The other S&ucirc;tras also (which
refer to the Self of bliss<a id="footnotetag114" name=
"footnotetag114"></a><a href="#footnote114"><sup>114</sup></a>) are
to be considered, as well as they may, as conveying a knowledge of
Brahman, which (Brahman) is referred to in the passage about the
tail.</p>
<p>20. The one within (the sun and the eye) (is the highest Lord),
on account of his qualities being declared<a id="footnotetag115"
name="footnotetag115"></a><a href=
"#footnote115"><sup>115</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The following passage is found in Scripture (Ch. Up. I, 6, 6
ff.), 'Now that person bright as gold who is seen within
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>{78}</span>
the sun, with beard bright as gold and hair bright as gold, bright
as gold altogether to the very tips of his nails, whose eyes are
like blue lotus; his name is Ut, for he has risen (udita) above all
evil. He also who knows this rises above all evil. So much with
reference to the devas.' And further on, with reference to the
body, 'Now the person who is seen in the eye,' &amp;c. Here the
following doubt presents itself. Do these passages point out, as
the object of devotion directed on the sphere of the sun and the
eye, merely some special individual soul, which, by means of a
large measure of knowledge and pious works, has raised itself to a
position of eminence; or do they refer to the eternally perfect
highest Lord?</p>
<p>The p&ucirc;rvapakshin takes the former view. An individual
soul, he says, is referred to, since Scripture speaks of a definite
shape. To the person in the sun special features are ascribed, such
as the possession of a beard as bright as gold and so on, and the
same features manifestly belong to the person in the eye also,
since they are expressly transferred to it in the passage, 'The
shape of this person is the same as the shape of that person.'
That, on the other hand, no shape can be ascribed to the highest
Lord, follows from the passage (Kau. Up. I, 3, 15), 'That which is
without sound, without touch, without form, without decay.' That an
individual soul is meant follows moreover from the fact that a
definite abode is mentioned, 'He who is in the sun; he who is in
the eye.' About the highest Lord, who has no special abode, but
abides in his own glory, no similar statement can be made; compare,
for instance, the two following passages, 'Where does he rest? In
his own glory?' (Ch. Up. VII, 24, 1); and 'like the ether he is
omnipresent, eternal.' A further argument for our view is supplied
by the fact that the might (of the being in question) is said to be
limited; for the passage, 'He is lord of the worlds beyond that,
and of the wishes of the devas,' indicates the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>{79}</span> limitation
of the might of the person in the sun; and the passage, 'He is lord
of the worlds beneath that and of the wishes of men,' indicates the
limitation of the might of the person in the eye. No limit, on the
other hand, can be admitted of the might of the highest Lord, as
appears from the passage (B<i>ri</i>. Up. IV, 4, 22), 'He is the
Lord of all, the king of all things, the protector of all things.
He is a bank and a boundary so that these worlds may not be
confounded;' which passage intimates that the Lord is free from all
limiting distinctions. For all these reasons the person in the eye
and the sun cannot be the highest Lord.</p>
<p>To this reasoning the S&ucirc;tra replies, 'The one within, on
account of his qualities being declared.' The person referred to in
the passages concerning the person within the sun and the person
within the eye is not a transmigrating being, but the highest Lord.
Why? Because his qualities are declared. For the qualities of the
highest Lord are indicated in the text as follows. At first the
name of the person within the sun is mentioned&mdash;'his name is
Ut'&mdash;and then this name is explained on the ground of that
person being free from all evil, 'He has risen above all evil.' The
same name thus explained is then transferred to the person in the
eye, in the clause, 'the name of the one is the name of the other.'
Now, entire freedom from sin is attributed in Scripture to the
highest Self only; so, for instance (Ch. Up. VIII, 7, 1), 'The Self
which is free from sin,' &amp;c. Then, again, there is the passage,
'He is <i>Ri</i>k, he is S&acirc;man, Uktha, Yajus, Brahman,' which
declares the person in the eye to be the Self of the <i>Ri</i>k,
S&acirc;man, and so on; which is possible only if that person is
the Lord who, as being the cause of all, is to be considered as the
Self of all. Moreover, the text, after having stated in succession
<i>Ri</i>k and S&acirc;man to have earth and fire for their Self
with reference to the Devas, and, again, speech and breath with
reference to the body, continues, '<i>Ri</i>k and S&acirc;man are
his joints,' with reference to the Devas, and 'the joints of the
one are the joints of the other,' with reference to the body. Now
this statement <span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id=
"page80"></a>{80}</span> also can be made only with regard to that
which is the Self of all. Further, the passage, 'Therefore all who
sing to the V&icirc;n&acirc; sing him, and from him also they
obtain wealth,' shows that the being spoken of is the sole topic of
all worldly songs; which again holds true of the highest Lord only.
That absolute command over the objects of worldly desires (as
displayed, for instance, in the bestowal of wealth) entitles us to
infer that the Lord is meant, appears also from the following
passage of the Bhagavad-g&icirc;t&acirc; (X, 41), 'Whatever being
there is possessing power, glory, or strength, know it to be
produced from a portion of my energy<a id="footnotetag116" name=
"footnotetag116"></a><a href="#footnote116"><sup>116</sup></a>.' To
the objection that the statements about bodily shape contained in
the clauses, 'With a beard bright as gold,' &amp;c., cannot refer
to the highest Lord, we reply that the highest Lord also may, when
he pleases, assume a bodily shape formed of M&acirc;y&acirc;, in
order to gratify thereby his devout worshippers. Thus Sm<i>ri</i>ti
also says, 'That thou seest me, O N&acirc;rada, is the
M&acirc;y&acirc; emitted by me; do not then look on me as endowed
with the qualities of all beings.' We have further to note that
expressions such as, 'That which is without sound, without touch,
without form, without decay,' are made use of where instruction is
given about the nature of the highest Lord in so far as he is
devoid of all qualities; while passages such as the following one,
'He to whom belong all works, all desires, all sweet odours and
tastes' (Ch. Up. III, 14, 2), which represent the highest Lord as
the object of devotion, speak of him, who is the cause of
everything, as possessing some of the qualities of his effects.
Analogously he may be spoken of, in the passage under discussion,
as having a beard bright as gold and so on. With reference to the
objection that the highest Lord cannot be meant because an abode is
spoken of, we remark that, for the purposes of devout meditation, a
special abode may be assigned to Brahman, although it abides in its
own glory only; for as Brahman is, like ether, all-pervading, it
may be viewed as <span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id=
"page81"></a>{81}</span> being within the Self of all beings. The
statement, finally, about the limitation of Brahman's might, which
depends on the distinction of what belongs to the gods and what to
the body, has likewise reference to devout meditation only. From
all this it follows that the being which Scripture states to be
within the eye and the sun is the highest Lord.</p>
<p>21. And there is another one (i.e. the Lord who is different
from the individual souls animating the sun, &amp;c.), on account
of the declaration of distinction.</p>
<p>There is, moreover, one distinct from the individual souls which
animate the sun and other bodies, viz. the Lord who rules within;
whose distinction (from all individual souls) is proclaimed in the
following scriptural passage, 'He who dwells in the sun and within
the sun, whom the sun does not know, whose body the sun is, and who
rules the sun within; he is thy Self, the ruler within, the
immortal' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. III, 7, 9). Here the expression, 'He
within the sun whom the sun does not know,' clearly indicates that
the Ruler within is distinct from that cognising individual soul
whose body is the sun. With that Ruler within we have to identify
the person within the sun, according to the tenet of the sameness
of purport of all Ved&acirc;nta-texts. It thus remains a settled
conclusion that the passage under discussion conveys instruction
about the highest Lord.</p>
<p>22. The &acirc;k&acirc;<i>s</i>a, i.e. ether (is Brahman) on
account of characteristic marks (of the latter being
mentioned).</p>
<p>In the Ch&acirc;ndogya (I, 9) the following passage is met with,
'What is the origin of this world?' 'Ether,' he replied. 'For all
these beings take their rise from the ether only, and return into
the ether. Ether is greater than these, ether is their
rest.'&mdash;Here the following doubt arises. Does the word 'ether'
denote the highest Brahman or the elemental ether?&mdash;Whence the
doubt?&mdash;Because the word is seen to be used in both senses.
Its use in the sense of 'elemental ether' is well established in
ordinary as well as in Vedic speech; <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page82" id="page82"></a>{82}</span> and, on the other hand, we see
that it is sometimes used to denote Brahman, viz. in cases where we
ascertain, either from some complementary sentence or from the fact
of special qualities being mentioned, that Brahman is meant. So,
for instance, Taitt. Up. II, 7, 'If that bliss existed not in the
ether;' and Ch. Up. VIII, 14, 'That which is called ether is the
revealer of all forms and names; that within which forms and names
are<a id="footnotetag117" name="footnotetag117"></a><a href=
"#footnote117"><sup>117</sup></a> that is Brahman.' Hence the
doubt.&mdash;Which sense is then to be adopted in our
case?&mdash;The sense of elemental ether, the p&ucirc;rvapakshin
replies; because this sense belongs to the word more commonly, and
therefore presents itself to the mind more readily. The word
'ether' cannot be taken in both senses equally, because that would
involve a (faulty) attribution of several meanings to one and the
same word. Hence the term 'ether' applies to Brahman in a secondary
(metaphorical) sense only; on account of Brahman being in many of
its attributes, such as all pervadingness and the like, similar to
ether. The rule is, that when the primary sense of a word is
possible, the word must not be taken in a secondary sense. And in
the passage under discussion only the primary sense of the word
'ether' is admissible. Should it be objected that, if we refer the
passage under discussion to the elemental ether, a complementary
passage ('for all these beings take their rise from the ether only,
&amp;c.') cannot be satisfactorily accounted for; we reply that the
elemental ether also may be represented as a cause, viz. of air,
fire, &amp;c. in due succession. For we read in Scripture (Taitt.
Up. II, 1), 'From that Self sprang ether, from ether air, from air
fire, and so on.' The qualities also of being greater and of being
a place of rest may be ascribed to the elemental ether, if we
consider its relations to all other beings. Therefore we conclude
that the word 'ether' here denotes the elemental ether.</p>
<p>To this we reply as follows:&mdash;The word ether must here be
taken to denote Brahman, on account of characteristic marks of the
latter being mentioned. For the sentence, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>{83}</span> 'All these
beings take their rise from the ether only,' clearly indicates the
highest Brahman, since all Ved&acirc;nta-texts agree in definitely
declaring that all beings spring from the highest
Brahman.&mdash;But, the opponent may say, we have shown that the
elemental ether also may be represented as the cause, viz. of air,
fire, and the other elements in due succession.&mdash;We admit
this. But still there remains the difficulty, that, unless we
understand the word to apply to the fundamental cause of all, viz.
Brahman, the affirmation contained in the word 'only' and the
qualification expressed by the word 'all' (in 'all beings') would
be out of place. Moreover, the clause, 'They return into the
ether,' again points to Brahman, and so likewise the phrase, 'Ether
is greater than these, ether is their rest;' for absolute
superiority in point of greatness Scripture attributes to the
highest Self only; cp. Ch. Up. III, 14, 3, 'Greater than the earth,
greater than the sky, greater than heaven, greater than all these
worlds.' The quality of being a place of rest likewise agrees best
with the highest Brahman, on account of its being the highest
cause. This is confirmed by the following scriptural passage:
'Knowledge and bliss is Brahman, it is the rest of him who gives
gifts' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. III, 9, 28). Moreover, Jaivali finding
fault with the doctrine of <i>S</i>&acirc;l&acirc;vatya, on account
of (his s&acirc;man) having an end (Ch. Up. I, 8, 8), and wishing
to proclaim something that has no end chooses the ether, and then,
having identified the ether with the Udg&icirc;tha, concludes, 'He
is the Udg&icirc;tha greater than great; he is without end.' Now
this endlessness is a characteristic mark of Brahman. To the remark
that the sense of 'elemental ether' presents itself to the mind
more readily, because it is the better established sense of the
word &acirc;k&acirc;<i>s</i>a, we reply, that, although it may
present itself to the mind first, yet it is not to be accepted,
because we see that qualities of Brahman are mentioned in the
complementary sentences. That the word &acirc;k&acirc;<i>s</i>a is
also used to denote Brahman has been shown already; cp. such
passages as, 'Ether is the revealer of all names and forms.' We
see, moreover, that various synonyma of &acirc;k&acirc;<i>s</i>a
are employed to denote Brahman. So, for instance, <i>Ri</i>k
Sa<i>m</i>h. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id=
"page84"></a>{84}</span> I, 164, 39, 'In which the Vedas are<a id=
"footnotetag118" name="footnotetag118"></a><a href=
"#footnote118"><sup>118</sup></a>, in the Imperishable one (i.e.
Brahman), the highest, the ether (vyoman), on which all gods have
their seat.' And Taitt. Up. III, 6, 'This is the knowledge of
Bh<i>ri</i>gu and Varu<i>n</i>a, founded on the highest ether
(vyoman).' And again, 'Om, ka is Brahman, ether (kha) is Brahman'
(Ch. Up. IV, 10, 5), and 'the old ether' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. V,
1)<a id="footnotetag119" name="footnotetag119"></a><a href=
"#footnote119"><sup>119</sup></a>. And other similar passages. On
account of the force of the complementary passage we are justified
in deciding that the word 'ether,' although occurring in the
beginning of the passage, refers to Brahman. The case is analogous
to that of the sentence, 'Agni (lit. the fire) studies a chapter,'
where the word agni, although occurring in the beginning, is at
once seen to denote a boy<a id="footnotetag120" name=
"footnotetag120"></a><a href="#footnote120"><sup>120</sup></a>. It
is therefore settled that the word 'ether' denotes Brahman.</p>
<p>23. For the same reason breath (is Brahman).</p>
<p>Concerning the udg&icirc;tha it is said (Ch. Up. I, 10, 9),
'Prastot<i>ri</i>, that deity which belongs to the prast&acirc;va,
&amp;c.,' and, further on (I, 11, 4; 5), 'Which then is that deity?
He said: Breath. For all these beings merge into breath alone, and
from breath they arise. This is the deity belonging to the
prast&acirc;va.' With reference to this passage doubt and decision
are to be considered as analogous to those stated under the
preceding S&ucirc;tra. For while in some passages&mdash;as, for
instance, 'For indeed, my son, mind is fastened to
pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a,' Ch. Up. VI, 8, 2; and, 'the pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a
of pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a,' B<i>ri</i>. Up. IV, 4, 18&mdash;the word
'breath' is seen to denote Brahman, its use <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>{85}</span> in the sense
of a certain modification of air is better established in common as
well as in Vedic language. Hence there arises a doubt whether in
the passage under discussion the word pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a denotes
Brahman or (ordinary) breath. In favour of which meaning have we
then to decide?</p>
<p>Here the p&ucirc;rvapakshin maintains that the word must be held
to denote the fivefold vital breath, which is a peculiar
modification of wind (or air); because, as has been remarked
already, that sense of the word pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a is the better
established one.&mdash;But no, an objector will say, just as in the
case of the preceding S&ucirc;tra, so here also Brahman is meant,
on account of characteristic marks being mentioned; for here also a
complementary passage gives us to understand that all beings spring
from and merge into pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a; a process which can take
place in connexion with the highest Lord only.&mdash;This
objection, the p&ucirc;rvapakshin replies, is futile, since we see
that the beings enter into and proceed from the principal vital air
also. For Scripture makes the following statement (Sat. Br. X, 3,
3, 6), 'When man sleeps, then into breath indeed speech merges,
into breath the eye, into breath the ear, into breath the mind;
when he awakes then they spring again from breath alone.' What the
Veda here states is, moreover, a matter of observation, for during
sleep, while the process of breathing goes on uninterruptedly, the
activity of the sense organs is interrupted and again becomes
manifest at the time of awaking only. And as the sense organs are
the essence of all material beings, the complementary passage which
speaks of the merging and emerging of the beings can be reconciled
with the principal vital air also. Moreover, subsequently to
pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a being mentioned as the divinity of the
prast&acirc;va the sun and food are designated as the divinities of
the udgitha and the pratib&acirc;ra. Now as they are not Brahman,
the pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a also, by parity of reasoning, cannot be
Brahman.</p>
<p>To this argumentation the author of the S&ucirc;tras replies:
For the same reason pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a&mdash;that means: on account
of the presence of characteristic marks&mdash;which constituted the
reason stated in the preceding S&ucirc;tra&mdash;the word
pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a also <span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id=
"page86"></a>{86}</span> must be held to denote Brahman. For
Scripture says of pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a also, that it is connected
with marks characteristic of Brahman. The sentence, 'All these
beings merge into breath alone, and from breath they arise,' which
declares that the origination and retractation of all beings depend
on pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a, clearly shows pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a to be
Brahman. In reply to the assertion that the origination and
retractation of all beings can be reconciled equally well with the
assumption of pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a denoting the chief vital air,
because origination and retractation take place in the state of
waking and of sleep also, we remark that in those two states only
the senses are merged into, and emerge from, the chief vital air,
while, according to the scriptural passage, 'For all these beings,
&amp;c.,' all beings whatever into which a living Self has entered,
together with their senses and bodies, merge and emerge by turns.
And even if the word 'beings' were taken (not in the sense of
animated beings, but) in the sense of material elements in general,
there would be nothing in the way of interpreting the passage as
referring to Brahman.&mdash;But, it may be said, that the senses
together with their objects do, during sleep, enter into
pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a, and again issue from it at the time of waking,
we distinctly learn from another scriptural passage, viz. Kau. Up.
III, 3, 'When a man being thus asleep sees no dream whatever, he
becomes one with that pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a alone. Then speech goes to
him with all names,' &amp;c.&mdash;True, we reply, but there also
the word pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a denotes (not the vital air) but
Brahman, as we conclude from characteristic marks of Brahman being
mentioned. The objection, again, that the word pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a
cannot denote Brahman because it occurs in proximity to the words
'food' and 'sun' (which do not refer to Brahman), is altogether
baseless; for proximity is of no avail against the force of the
complementary passage which intimates that pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a is
Brahman. That argument, finally, which rests on the fact that the
word pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a commonly denotes the vital air with its
five modifications, is to be refuted in the same way as the
parallel argument which the p&ucirc;rvapakshin brought forward with
reference to the word 'ether.' From all this it follows that the
pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a, which is the deity of the prast&acirc;va, is
Brahman.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>{87}</span>
<p>Some (commentators)<a id="footnotetag121" name=
"footnotetag121"></a><a href="#footnote121"><sup>121</sup></a>
quote under the present S&ucirc;tra the following passages, 'the
pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a of pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. IV, 4,
18), and 'for to pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a mind is fastened' (Ch. Up. VI,
8, 2). But that is wrong since these two passages offer no
opportunity for any discussion, the former on account of the
separation of the words, the latter on account of the general
topic. When we meet with a phrase such as 'the father of the
father' we understand at once that the genitive denotes a father
different from the father denoted by the nominative. Analogously we
infer from the separation of words contained in the phrase, 'the
breath of breath,' that the 'breath of breath' is different from
the ordinary breath (denoted by the genitive 'of breath'). For one
and the same thing cannot, by means of a genitive, be predicated
of&mdash;and thus distinguished from&mdash;itself. Concerning the
second passage we remark that, if the matter constituting the
general topic of some chapter is referred to in that chapter under
a different name, we yet conclude, from the general topic, that
that special matter is meant. For instance, when we meet in the
section which treats of the jyotish<i>t</i>oma sacrifice with the
passage, 'in every spring he is to offer the jyotis sacrifice,' we
at once understand that the word denotes the jyotish<i>t</i>oma. If
we therefore meet with the clause 'to pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a mind is
fastened' in a section of which the highest Brahman is the topic,
we do not for a moment suppose that the word pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a
should there denote the ordinary breath which is a mere
modification of air. The two passages thus do not offer any matter
for discussion, and hence do not furnish appropriate instances for
the S&ucirc;tra. We have shown, on the other hand, that the passage
about the pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a, which is the deity of the
prast&acirc;va, allows room for doubt, p&ucirc;rvapaksha and final
decision.</p>
<p>24. The 'light' (is Brahman), on account of the mention of feet
(in a passage which is connected with the passage about the
light).</p>
<p>Scripture says (Ch. Up. III, 13, 7), 'Now that light which
shines above this heaven, higher than all, higher than everything,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>{88}</span>
in the highest worlds beyond which there are no other worlds that
is the same light which is within man.' Here the doubt presents
itself whether the word 'light' denotes the light of the sun and
the like, or the highest Self. Under the preceding S&ucirc;tras we
had shown that some words which ordinarily have different meanings
yet in certain passages denote Brahman, since characteristic marks
of the latter are mentioned. Here the question has to be discussed
whether, in connexion with the passage quoted, characteristic marks
of Brahman are mentioned or not.</p>
<p>The p&ucirc;rvapakshin maintains that the word 'light' denotes
nothing else but the light of the sun and the like, since that is
the ordinary well-established meaning of the term. The common use
of language, he says, teaches us that the two words 'light' and
'darkness' denote mutually opposite things, darkness being the term
for whatever interferes with the function of the sense of sight,
as, for instance, the gloom of the night, while sunshine and
whatever else favours the action of the eye is called light. The
word 'shines' also, which the text exhibits, is known ordinarily to
refer to the sun and similar sources of light; while of Brahman,
which is devoid of colour, it cannot be said, in the primary sense
of the word, that it 'shines.' Further, the word jyotis must here
denote light because it is said to be bounded by the sky ('that
light which shines above this heaven'). For while it is impossible
to consider the sky as being the boundary of Brahman, which is the
Self of all and the source of all things movable or immovable, the
sky may be looked upon as forming the boundary of light, which is a
mere product and as such limited; accordingly the text says, 'the
light beyond heaven.'&mdash;But light, although a mere product, is
perceived everywhere; it would therefore be wrong to declare that
it is bounded by the sky!&mdash;Well, then, the p&ucirc;rvapakshin
replies, let us assume that the light meant is the first-born
(original) light which has not yet become tripartite<a id=
"footnotetag122" name="footnotetag122"></a><a href=
"#footnote122"><sup>122</sup></a>. This explanation again cannot be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>{89}</span>
admitted, because the non-tripartite light does not serve any
purpose.&mdash;But, the p&ucirc;rvapakshin resumes, Why should its
purpose not be found therein that it is the object of devout
meditation?&mdash;That cannot be, we reply; for we see that only
such things are represented as objects of devotion as have some
other independent use of their own; so, for instance, the sun
(which dispels darkness and so on). Moreover the scriptural
passage, 'Let me make each of these three (fire, water, and earth)
tripartite,' does not indicate any difference<a id="footnotetag123"
name="footnotetag123"></a><a href=
"#footnote123"><sup>123</sup></a>. And even of the non-tripartite
light it is not known that the sky constitutes its
boundary.&mdash;Well, then (the p&ucirc;rvapakshin resumes,
dropping the idea of the non-tripartite light), let us assume that
the light of which the text speaks is the tripartite (ordinary)
light. The objection that light is seen to exist also beneath the
sky, viz. in the form of fire and the like, we invalidate by the
remark that there is nothing contrary to reason in assigning a
special locality to fire, although the latter is observed
everywhere; while to assume a special place for Brahman, to which
the idea of place does not apply at all, would be most unsuitable.
Moreover, the clause 'higher than everything, in the highest worlds
beyond which there are no other worlds,' which indicates a
multiplicity of abodes, agrees much better with light, which is a
mere product (than with Brahman). There is moreover that other
clause, also, 'That is the same light which is within man,' in
which the highest light is identified with the gastric fire (the
fire within man). Now such identifications can be made only where
there is a certain similarity of nature; as is seen, for instance,
in the passage, 'Of that person Bh&ucirc;<i>h</i> is the head, for
the head is one and that syllable is one' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. V, 5,
3). But that the fire within the human body is not Brahman clearly
appears from the passage, 'Of this we have visible and audible
proof' (Ch. Up. III, 13, 7; 8), which declares that <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>{90}</span> the fire is
characterised by the noise it makes, and by heat; and likewise from
the following passage, 'Let a man meditate on this as that which is
seen and heard.' The same conclusion may be drawn from the passage,
'He who knows this becomes conspicuous and celebrated,' which
proclaims an inconsiderable reward only, while to the devout
meditation on Brahman a high reward would have to be allotted. Nor
is there mentioned in the entire passage about the light any other
characteristic mark of Brahman, while such marks are set forth in
the passages (discussed above) which refer to pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a
and the ether. Nor, again, is Brahman indicated in the preceding
section, 'the G&acirc;yatr&icirc; is everything whatsoever exists,'
&amp;c. (III, 12); for that passage makes a statement about the
G&acirc;yatr&icirc; metre only. And even if that section did refer
to Brahman, still Brahman would not be recognised in the passage at
present under discussion; for there (in the section referred to) it
is declared in the clause, 'Three feet of it are the Immortal in
heaven'&mdash;that heaven constitutes the abode; while in our
passage the words 'the light above heaven' declare heaven to be a
boundary. For all these reasons the word jyotis is here to be taken
in its ordinary meaning, viz. light.</p>
<p>To this we make the following reply. The word jyotis must be
held to denote Brahman. Why? On account of the feet (quarters)
being mentioned. In a preceding passage Brahman had been spoken of
as having four feet (quarters). 'Such is the greatness of it;
greater than it is the Person (purusha). One foot of it are all the
beings, three feet of it are the Immortal in heaven.' That which in
this passage is said to constitute the three-quarter part, immortal
and connected with heaven, of Brahman, which altogether comprises
four quarters; this very same entity we recognise as again referred
to in the passage under discussion, because there also it is said
to be connected with heaven. If therefore we should set it aside in
our interpretation of the passage and assume the latter to refer to
the ordinary light, we should commit the mistake of dropping,
without need, the topic started and introducing <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>{91}</span> a new
subject. Brahman, in fact, continues to form the subject-matter,
not only of the passage about the light, but likewise of the
subsequent section, the so-called S&acirc;<i>nd</i>ilya-vidy&acirc;
(Ch. Up. III, 14). Hence we conclude that in our passage the word
'light' must be held to denote Brahman. The objection (raised
above) that from common use the words 'light' and 'to shine' are
known to denote effected (physical) light is without force; for as
it is known from the general topic of the chapter that Brahman is
meant, those two words do not necessarily denote physical light
only to the exclusion of Brahman<a id="footnotetag124" name=
"footnotetag124"></a><a href="#footnote124"><sup>124</sup></a>, but
may also denote Brahman itself, in so far as it is characterised by
the physical shining light which is its effect. Analogously another
mantra declares, 'that by which the sun shines kindled with heat'
(Taitt. Br. III, 12, 9, 7). Or else we may suppose that the word
jyotis here does not denote at all that light on which the function
of the eye depends. For we see that in other passages it has
altogether different meanings; so, for instance, B<i>ri</i>. Up.
IV, 3, 5, 'With speech only as light man sits,' and Taitt. Sa. I,
6, 3, 3, 'May the mind, the light, accept,' &amp;c. It thus appears
that whatever illuminates (in the different senses of the word)
something else may be spoken of as 'light.' Hence to Brahman also,
whose nature is intelligence, the term 'light' may be applied; for
it gives light to the entire world. Similarly, other scriptural
passages say, 'Him the shining one, everything shines after; by his
light all this is lighted' (Kau. Up. II, 5, 15); and 'Him the gods
worship as the light of lights, as the immortal' (B<i>ri</i>. Up.
IV, 4, 16). Against the further objection that the omnipresent
Brahman cannot be viewed as bounded by heaven we remark that the
assignment, to Brahman, of a special locality is not contrary to
reason because it subserves the purpose of devout meditation. Nor
does it avail anything to say that it is impossible to assign any
place to Brahman because Brahman is out of connexion with all
place. For it is possible to make such <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>{92}</span> an
assumption, because Brahman is connected with certain limiting
adjuncts. Accordingly Scripture speaks of different kinds of devout
meditation on Brahman as specially connected with certain
localities, such as the sun, the eye, the heart. For the same
reason it is also possible to attribute to Brahman a multiplicity
of abodes, as is done in the clause (quoted above) 'higher than
all.' The further objection that the light beyond heaven is the
mere physical light because it is identified with the gastric fire,
which itself is a mere effect and is inferred from perceptible
marks such as the heat of the body and a certain sound, is equally
devoid of force; for the gastric fire may be viewed as the outward
appearance (or symbol) of Brahman, just as Brahman's name is a mere
outward symbol. Similarly in the passage, 'Let a man meditate on it
(the gastric light) as seen and heard,' the visibility and
audibility (here implicitly ascribed to Brahman) must be considered
as rendered possible through the gastric fire being the outward
appearance of Brahman. Nor is there any force in the objection that
Brahman cannot be meant because the text mentions an inconsiderable
reward only; for there is no reason compelling us to have recourse
to Brahman for the purpose of such and such a reward only, and not
for the purpose of such and such another reward. Wherever the text
represents the highest Brahman&mdash;which is free from all
connexion with distinguishing attributes&mdash;as the universal
Self, it is understood that the result of that instruction is one
only, viz. final release. Wherever, on the other hand, Brahman is
taught to be connected with distinguishing attributes or outward
symbols, there, we see, all the various rewards which this world
can offer are spoken of; cp. for instance, B<i>ri</i>. Up. IV, 4,
24, 'This is he who eats all food, the giver of wealth. He who
knows this obtains wealth.' Although in the passage itself which
treats of the light no characteristic mark of Brahman is mentioned,
yet, as the S&ucirc;tra intimates, the mark stated in a preceding
passage (viz. the mantra, 'Such is the greatness of it,' &amp;c.)
has to be taken in connexion with the passage about the light as
well. The question how the mere circumstance of Brahman being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>{93}</span>
mentioned in a not distant passage can have the power of divorcing
from its natural object and transferring to another object the
direct statement about light implied in the word 'light,' may be
answered without difficulty. The passage under discussion
runs<a id="footnotetag125" name="footnotetag125"></a><a href=
"#footnote125"><sup>125</sup></a>, 'which above this heaven, the
light.' The relative pronoun with which this clause begins
intimates, according to its grammatical force<a id="footnotetag126"
name="footnotetag126"></a><a href=
"#footnote126"><sup>126</sup></a>, the same Brahman which was
mentioned in the previous passage, and which is here recognised (as
being the same which was mentioned before) through its connexion
with heaven; hence the word jyotis also&mdash;which stands in
grammatical co-ordination to 'which'&mdash;must have Brahman for
its object. From all this it follows that the word 'light' here
denotes Brahman.</p>
<p>25. If it be objected that (Brahman is) not (denoted) on account
of the metre being denoted; (we reply) not so, because thus (i.e.
by means of the metre) the direction of the mind (on Brahman) is
declared; for thus it is seen (in other passages also).</p>
<p>We now address ourselves to the refutation of the assertion
(made in the p&ucirc;rvapaksha of the preceding S&ucirc;tra) that
in the previous passage also Brahman is not referred to, because in
the sentence, 'G&acirc;yatr&icirc; is everything whatsoever here
exists,' the metre called G&acirc;yatr&icirc; is spoken
of.&mdash;How (we ask the p&ucirc;rvapakshin) can it be maintained
that, on account of the metre being spoken of, Brahman is not
denoted, while yet the mantra 'such is the greatness of it,'
&amp;c., clearly sets forth Brahman with its four
quarters?&mdash;You are mistaken (the p&ucirc;rvapakshin replies).
The sentence, 'G&acirc;yatr&icirc; is everything,' starts the
discussion of G&acirc;yatr&icirc;. The same G&acirc;yatr&icirc; is
thereupon described under the various forms of all beings, earth,
body, heart, speech, breath; to which there refers also the verse,
'that G&acirc;yatr&icirc; <span class="pagenum"><a name="page94"
id="page94"></a>{94}</span> has four feet and is sixfold.' After
that we meet with the mantra, 'Such is the greatness of it.'
&amp;c. How then, we ask, should this mantra, which evidently is
quoted with reference to the G&acirc;yatr&icirc; (metre) as
described in the preceding clauses, all at once denote Brahman with
its four quarters? Since therefore the metre G&acirc;yatr&icirc; is
the subject-matter of the entire chapter, the term 'Brahman' which
occurs in a subsequent passage ('the Brahman which has thus been
described') must also denote the metre. This is analogous to a
previous passage (Ch. Up. III, 11, 3, 'He who thus knows this
Brahma-upanishad'), where the word Brahma-upanishad is explained to
mean Veda-upanishad. As therefore the preceding passage refers (not
to Brahman, but) to the G&acirc;yatr&icirc; metre, Brahman does not
constitute the topic of the entire section.</p>
<p>This argumentation, we reply, proves nothing against our
position. 'Because thus direction of the mind is declared,' i.e.
because the Brahma<i>n</i>a passage, 'G&acirc;yatr&icirc; indeed is
all this,' intimates that by means of the metre G&acirc;yatr&icirc;
the mind is to be directed on Brahman which is connected with that
metre. Of the metre G&acirc;yatr&icirc;, which is nothing but a
certain special combination of syllables, it could not possibly be
said that it is the Self of everything. We therefore have to
understand the passage as declaring that Brahman, which, as the
cause of the world, is connected with that product also whose name
is G&acirc;yatr&icirc;, is 'all this;' in accordance with that
other passage which directly says, 'All this indeed is Brahman'
(Kh. Up. III, 14, 1). That the effect is in reality not different
from the cause, we shall prove later on, under S&ucirc;tra II, 1,
14. Devout meditation on Brahman under the form of certain effects
(of Brahman) is seen to be mentioned in other passages also, so,
for instance, Ait. &Acirc;r. III, 2, 3, 12, 'For the
Bahv<i>rik</i>as consider him in the great hymn, the Adhvaryus in
the sacrificial fire, the Chandogas in the Mah&acirc;vrata
ceremony.' Although, therefore, the previous passage speaks of the
metre, Brahman is what is meant, and the same Brahman is again
referred to in the passage about the light, whose purport it is to
enjoin another form of devout meditation.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>{95}</span>
<p>Another commentator<a id="footnotetag127" name=
"footnotetag127"></a><a href="#footnote127"><sup>127</sup></a> is
of opinion that the term G&acirc;yatr&icirc; (does not denote
Brahman in so far as viewed under the form of G&acirc;yatr&icirc;,
but) directly denotes Brahman, on account of the equality of
number; for just as the G&acirc;yatr&icirc; metre has four feet
consisting of six syllables each, so Brahman also has four feet,
(i.e. quarters.) Similarly we see that in other passages also the
names of metres are used to denote other things which resemble
those metres in certain numerical relations; cp. for instance, Ch.
Up. IV, 3, 8, where it is said at first, 'Now these five and the
other five make ten and that is the K<i>ri</i>ta,' and after that
'these are again the Vir&acirc;j which eats the food.' If we adopt
this interpretation, Brahman only is spoken of, and the metre is
not referred to at all. In any case Brahman is the subject with
which the previous passage is concerned.</p>
<p>26. And thus also (we must conclude, viz. that Brahman is the
subject of the previous passage), because (thus only) the
declaration as to the beings, &amp;c. being the feet is
possible.</p>
<p>That the previous passage has Brahman for its topic, we must
assume for that reason also that the text designates the beings and
so on as the feet of G&acirc;yatr&icirc;. For the text at first
speaks of the beings, the earth, the body, and the heart<a id=
"footnotetag128" name="footnotetag128"></a><a href=
"#footnote128"><sup>128</sup></a>, and then goes on 'that
G&acirc;yatr&icirc; has four feet and is sixfold.' For of the mere
metre, without any reference to Brahman, it would be impossible to
say that the beings and so on are its feet. Moreover, if Brahman
were not meant, there would be no room for the verse, 'Such is the
greatness,' &amp;c. For that verse clearly describes Brahman in its
own nature; otherwise it would be impossible to represent the
G&acirc;yatr&icirc; as the Self of everything as is done in the
words, 'One foot of it are all the beings; three feet of it are
what is immortal in heaven.' The purusha-s&ucirc;kta also
(<i>Ri</i>k <span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id=
"page96"></a>{96}</span> Sa<i>m</i>h. X, 90) exhibits the verse
with sole reference to Brahman. Sm<i>ri</i>ti likewise ascribes to
Brahman a like nature, 'I stand supporting all this world by a
single portion of myself' (Bha. G&icirc;t&acirc; X, 42). Our
interpretation moreover enables us to take the passage, 'that
Brahman indeed which,' &amp;c. (III, 12, 7), in its primary sense,
(i.e. to understand the word Brahman to denote nothing but
Brahman.) And, moreover, the passage, 'these are the five men of
Brahman' (III, 13, 6), is appropriate only if the former passage
about the G&acirc;yatr&icirc; is taken as referring to Brahman (for
otherwise the 'Brahman' in 'men of Brahman' would not be connected
with the previous topic). Hence Brahman is to be considered as the
subject-matter of the previous passage also. And the decision that
the same Brahman is referred to in the passage about the light
where it is recognised (to be the same) from its connexion with
heaven, remains unshaken.</p>
<p>27. The objection that (the Brahman of the former passage cannot
be recognised in the latter) on account of the difference of
designation, is not valid because in either (designation) there is
nothing contrary (to the recognition).</p>
<p>The objection that in the former passage ('three feet of it are
what is immortal in heaven'), heaven is designated as the abode,
while in the latter passage ('that light which shines above this
heaven'), heaven is designated as the boundary, and that, on
account of this difference of designation, the subject-matter of
the former passage cannot be recognised in the latter, must
likewise be refuted. This we do by remarking that in either
designation nothing is contrary to the recognition. Just as in
ordinary language a falcon, although in contact with the top of a
tree, is not only said to be on the tree but also above the tree,
so Brahman also, although being in heaven, is here referred to as
being beyond heaven as well.</p>
<p>Another (commentator) explains: just as in ordinary language a
falcon, although not in contact with the top of a <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>{97}</span> tree, is not
only said to be above the top of the tree but also on the top of
the tree, so Brahman also, which is in reality beyond heaven, is
(in the former of the two passages) said to be in heaven. Therefore
the Brahman spoken of in the former passage can be recognised in
the latter also, and it remains therefore a settled conclusion that
the word 'light' denotes Brahman.</p>
<p>28. pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a (breath) is Brahman, that being
understood from a connected consideration (of the passages
referring to pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a).</p>
<p>In the Kaush&icirc;taki-br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a-upanishad there is
recorded a legend of Indra and Pratardana which begins with the
words, 'Pratardana, forsooth, the son of Divod&acirc;sa came by
means of fighting and strength to the beloved abode of Indra' (Kau.
Up. III, 1). In this legend we read: 'He said: I am
pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a, the intelligent Self
(praj<i>&ntilde;</i>&acirc;tman), meditate on me as Life, as
Immortality' (III, 2). And later on (III, 3), 'pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a
alone, the intelligent Self, having laid hold of this body, makes
it rise up.' Then, again (III, 8), 'Let no man try to find out what
speech is, let him know the speaker.' And in the end (III, 8),
'That breath indeed is the intelligent Self, bliss, imperishable,
immortal.'&mdash;Here the doubt presents itself whether the word
pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a denotes merely breath, the modification of air,
or the Self of some divinity, or the individual soul, or the
highest Brahman.&mdash;But, it will be said at the outset, the
S&ucirc;tra I, 1, 21 already has shown that the word
pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a refers to Brahman, and as here also we meet with
characteristic marks of Brahman, viz. the words 'bliss,
imperishable, immortal,' what reason is there for again raising the
same doubt?&mdash;We reply: Because there are observed here
characteristic marks of different kinds. For in the legend we meet
not only with marks indicating Brahman, but also with marks
pointing to other beings Thus Indra's words, 'Know me only' (III,
1) point to the Self of a divinity; the words, 'Having laid hold of
this body it makes it rise up,' point to the breath; the words,
'Let no man try to find out what speech is, let him know
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>{98}</span>
the speaker,' point to the individual soul. There is thus room for
doubt.</p>
<p>If, now, the p&ucirc;rvapakshin maintains that the term
pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a here denotes the well-known modification of air,
i.e. breath, we, on our side, assert that the word
pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a must be understood to denote Brahman.&mdash;For
what reason?&mdash;On account of such being the consecutive meaning
of the passages. For if we examine the connexion of the entire
section which treats of the pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a, we observe that all
the single passages can be construed into a whole only if they are
viewed as referring to Brahman. At the beginning of the legend
Pratardana, having been allowed by Indra to choose a boon, mentions
the highest good of man, which he selects for his boon, in the
following words, 'Do you yourself choose that boon for me which you
deem most beneficial for a man.' Now, as later on
pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a is declared to be what is most beneficial for
man, what should pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a denote but the highest Self?
For apart from the cognition of that Self a man cannot possibly
attain what is most beneficial for him, as many scriptural passages
declare. Compare, for instance, <i>S</i>ve. Up. III, 8, 'A man who
knows him passes over death; there is no other path to go.' Again,
the further passage, 'He who knows me thus by no deed of his is his
life harmed, not by theft, not by bhr&ucirc;<i>n</i>ahaty&acirc;'
(III, 1), has a meaning only if Brahman is supposed to be the
object of knowledge. For, that subsequently to the cognition of
Brahman all works and their effects entirely cease, is well known
from scriptural passages, such as the following, 'All works perish
when he has been beheld who is the higher and the lower' (Mu. Up.
II, 2, 8). Moreover, pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a can be identified with the
intelligent Self only if it is Brahman. For the air which is
non-intelligent can clearly not be the intelligent Self. Those
characteristic marks, again, which are mentioned in the concluding
passage (viz. those intimated by the words 'bliss,' 'imperishable,'
'immortal') can, if taken in their full sense, not be reconciled
with any being except Brahman. There are, moreover, the following
passages, 'He does not increase by a good action, nor decrease by a
bad action. For he makes him whom he wishes <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>{99}</span> to lead up
from these worlds do a good deed; and the same makes him whom he
wishes to lead down from these worlds do a bad deed;' and, 'He is
the guardian of the world, he is the king of the world, he is the
Lord of the world' (Kau. Up. III, 8). All this can be properly
understood only if the highest Brahman is acknowledged to be the
subject-matter of the whole chapter, not if the vital air is
substituted in its place. Hence the word pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a denotes
Brahman.</p>
<p>29. If it be said that (Brahman is) not (denoted) on account of
the speaker denoting himself; (we reply that this objection is not
valid) because there is in that (chapter) a multitude of references
to the interior Self.</p>
<p>An objection is raised against the assertion that
pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a denotes Brahman. The word pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a, it
is said, does not denote the highest Brahman, because the speaker
designates himself. The speaker, who is a certain powerful god
called Indra, at first says, in order to reveal himself to
Pratardana, 'Know me only,' and later on, 'I am pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a,
the intelligent Self.' How, it is asked, can the
pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a, which this latter passage, expressive of
personality as it is, represents as the Self of the speaker, be
Brahman to which, as we know from Scripture, the attribute of being
a speaker cannot be ascribed; compare, for instance, B<i>ri</i>.
Up. III, 8, 8, 'It is without speech, without mind.' Further on,
also, the speaker, i.e. Indra, glorifies himself by enumerating a
number of attributes, all of which depend on personal existence and
can in no way belong to Brahman, 'I slew the three-headed son of
Tvash<i>tri</i>; I delivered the Arunmukhas, the devotees, to the
wolves,' and so on. Indra may be called pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a on
account of his strength. Scripture says, 'Strength indeed is
pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a,' and Indra is known as the god of strength; and
of any deed of strength people say, 'It is Indra's work.' The
personal Self of a deity may, moreover, be called an intelligent
Self; for the gods, people say, possess unobstructed knowledge. It
thus being a settled matter that some passages convey information
about the personal Self <span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id=
"page100"></a>{100}</span> of some deity, the other passages
also&mdash;as, for instance, the one about what is most beneficial
for man&mdash;must be interpreted as well as they may with
reference to the same deity. Hence pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a does not
denote Brahman.</p>
<p>This objection we refute by the remark that in that chapter
there are found a multitude of references to the interior Self. For
the passage, 'As long as pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a dwells in this body so
long surely there is life,' declares that that pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a
only which is the intelligent interior Self&mdash;and not some
particular outward deity&mdash;has power to bestow and to take back
life. And where the text speaks of the eminence of the
pr&acirc;<i>n</i>as as founded on the existence of the
pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a, it shows that that pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a is meant
which has reference to the Self and is the abode of the
sense-organs.<a id="footnotetag129" name=
"footnotetag129"></a><a href="#footnote129"><sup>129</sup></a></p>
<p>Of the same tendency is the passage, 'pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a, the
intelligent Self, alone having laid hold of this body makes it rise
up;' and the passage (which occurs in the passus, 'Let no man try
to find out what speech is,' &amp;c.), 'For as in a car the
circumference of the wheel is set on the spokes and the spokes on
the nave, thus are these objects set on the subjects (the senses)
and the subjects on the pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a. And that
pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a indeed is the Self of pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a,
blessed, imperishable, immortal.' So also the following passage
which, referring to this interior Self, forming as it were the
centre of the peripherical interaction of the objects and senses,
sums up as follows, 'He is my Self, thus let it be known;' a
summing up which is appropriate only if pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a is meant
to denote not some outward existence, but the interior Self. And
another scriptural passage declares 'this Self is Brahman,
omniscient'<a id="footnotetag130" name=
"footnotetag130"></a><a href="#footnote130"><sup>130</sup></a>
(B<i>ri</i>. Up. II, 5, 19). We therefore arrive at <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>{101}</span> the
conclusion that, on account of the multitude of references to the
interior Self, the chapter contains information regarding Brahman,
not regarding the Self of some deity.&mdash;How then can the
circumstance of the speaker (Indra) referring to himself be
explained?</p>
<p>30. The declaration (made by Indra about himself, viz. that he
is one with Brahman) (is possible) through intuition vouched for by
Scripture, as in the case of V&acirc;madeva.</p>
<p>The individual divine Self called Indra perceiving by means of
<i>ri</i>shi-like intuition<a id="footnotetag131" name=
"footnotetag131"></a><a href=
"#footnote131"><sup>131</sup></a>&mdash;the existence of which is
vouched for by Scripture&mdash;its own Self to be identical with
the supreme Self, instructs Pratardana (about the highest Self) by
means of the words 'Know me only.'</p>
<p>By intuition of the same kind the <i>ri</i>shi V&acirc;madeva
reached the knowledge expressed in the words, 'I was Manu and
S&ucirc;rya;' in accordance with the passage, 'Whatever deva was
awakened (so as to know Brahman) he indeed became that'
(B<i>ri</i>. Up. I, 4, 10). The assertion made above (in the
p&ucirc;rvapaksha of the preceding S&ucirc;tra) that Indra after
saying, 'Know me only,' glorifies himself by enumerating the
slaying of Tvash<i>tri</i>'s son and other deeds of strength, we
refute as follows. The death of Tvash<i>tri</i>'s son and similar
deeds are referred to, not to the end of glorifying Indra as the
object of knowledge&mdash;in which case the sense of the passage
would be, 'Because I accomplished such and such deeds, therefore
know me'&mdash;but to the end of glorifying the cognition of the
highest Self. For this reason the text, after having referred to
the slaying of Tvash<i>tri</i>'s son and the like, goes on in the
clause next following to exalt knowledge, 'And not one hair of me
is harmed there. He who knows me thus by no deed of his is his life
harmed.'&mdash;(But how does this passage convey praise of
knowledge?)&mdash;Because, we reply, its meaning is as follows:
'Although I do such cruel deeds, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page102" id="page102"></a>{102}</span> yet not even a hair of mine
is harmed because I am one with Brahman; therefore the life of any
other person also who knows me thus is not harmed by any deed of
his.' And the object of the knowledge (praised by Indra) is nothing
else but Brahman which is set forth in a subsequent passage, 'I am
pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a, the intelligent Self.' Therefore the entire
chapter refers to Brahman.</p>
<p>31. If it be said (that Brahman is) not (meant), on account of
characteristic marks of the individual soul and the chief vital air
(being mentioned); we say no, on account of the threefoldness of
devout meditation (which would result from your interpretation); on
account of (the meaning advocated by us) being accepted
(elsewhere); and on account of (characteristic marks of Brahman)
being connected (with the passage under discussion).</p>
<p>Although we admit, the p&ucirc;rvapakshin resumes, that the
chapter about the pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a does not furnish any
instruction regarding some outward deity, since it contains a
multitude of references to the interior Self; still we deny that it
is concerned with Brahman.&mdash;For what reason?&mdash;Because it
mentions characteristic marks of the individual soul on the one
hand, and of the chief vital air on the other hand. The passage,
'Let no man try to find out what speech is, let him know the
speaker,' mentions a characteristic mark of the individual soul,
and must therefore be held to point out as the object of knowledge
the individual soul which rules and employs the different organs of
action such as speech and so on. On the other hand, we have the
passage, 'But pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a alone, the intelligent Self,
having laid hold of this body makes it rise up,' which points to
the chief vital air; for the chief attribute of the vital air is
that it sustains the body. Similarly, we read in the colloquy of
the vital airs (Pra. Up. II, 3), concerning speech and the other
vital airs, 'Then pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a (the chief vital air) as the
best said to them: Be not deceived; I alone dividing myself
fivefold support this body and keep it.' Those, again, who in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id=
"page103"></a>{103}</span> passage quoted above read 'this one
(masc.), the body<a id="footnotetag132" name=
"footnotetag132"></a><a href="#footnote132"><sup>132</sup></a>'
must give the following explanation, pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a having laid
hold of this one, viz. either the individual soul or the aggregate
of the sense organs, makes the body rise up. The individual soul as
well as the chief vital air may justly be designated as the
intelligent Self; for the former is of the nature of intelligence,
and the latter (although non-intelligent in itself) is the abode of
other pr&acirc;<i>n</i>as, viz. the sense organs, which are the
instruments of intelligence. Moreover, if the word
pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a be taken to denote the individual soul as well
as the chief vital air, the pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a and the intelligent
Self may be spoken of in two ways, either as being non-different on
account of their mutual concomitance, or as being different on
account of their (essentially different) individual character; and
in these two different ways they are actually spoken of in the two
following passages, 'What is pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a that is
praj<i>&ntilde;</i>&acirc;, what is praj<i>&ntilde;</i>&acirc; that
is pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a;' and, 'For together do these two live in the
body and together do they depart.' If, on the other hand,
pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a denoted Brahman, what then could be different
from what? For these reasons pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a does not denote
Brahman, but either the individual soul or the chief vital air or
both.</p>
<p>All this argumentation, we reply, is wrong, 'on account of the
threefoldness of devout meditation.' Your interpretation would
involve the assumption of devout meditation of three different
kinds, viz. on the individual soul, on the chief vital air, and on
Brahman. But it is inappropriate to assume that a single sentence
should enjoin three kinds of devout meditation; and that all the
passages about the pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a really constitute one single
sentence (one syntactical whole) appears from the beginning and the
concluding part. In the beginning we have the clause 'Know me
only,' followed by 'I am pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a, the intelligent Self,
meditate on me as Life, as Immortality;' and in the end we read,
'And that pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a indeed is the intelligent Self,
blessed, imperishable, immortal.' The beginning and the concluding
part are thus seen to be similar, and we <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>{104}</span> therefore
must conclude that they refer to one and the same matter. Nor can
the characteristic mark of Brahman be so turned as to be applied to
something else; for the ten objects and the ten subjects
(subjective powers)<a id="footnotetag133" name=
"footnotetag133"></a><a href="#footnote133"><sup>133</sup></a>
cannot rest on anything but Brahman. Moreover, pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a
must denote Brahman 'on account of (that meaning) being accepted,'
i.e. because in the case of other passages where characteristic
marks of Brahman are mentioned the word pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a is taken
in the sense of 'Brahman.' And another reason for assuming the
passage to refer to Brahman is that here also, i.e. in the passage
itself there is 'connexion' with characteristic marks of Brahman,
as, for instance, the reference to what is most beneficial for man.
The assertion that the passage, 'Having laid hold of this body it
makes it rise up,' contains a characteristic mark of the chief
vital air, is untrue; for as the function of the vital air also
ultimately rests on Brahman it can figuratively be ascribed to the
latter. So Scripture also declares, 'No mortal lives by the breath
that goes up and by the breath that goes down. We live by another
in whom these two repose' (Ka. Up. II, 5, 5). Nor does the
indication of the individual soul which you allege to occur in the
passage, 'Let no man try to find out what speech is, let him know
the speaker,' preclude the view of pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a denoting
Brahman. For, as the passages, 'I am Brahman,' 'That art thou,' and
others, prove, there is in reality no such thing as an individual
soul absolutely different from Brahman, but Brahman, in so far as
it differentiates itself through the mind (buddhi) and other
limiting conditions, is called individual soul, agent, enjoyer.
Such passages therefore as the one alluded to, (viz. 'let no man
try to find out what speech is, let him know the speaker,') which,
by setting aside all the differences due to limiting conditions,
aim at directing the mind on the internal Self and thus showing
that the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id=
"page105"></a>{105}</span> individual soul is one with Brahman, are
by no means out of place. That the Self which is active in speaking
and the like is Brahman appears from another scriptural passage
also, viz. Ke. Up. I, 5, 'That which is not expressed by speech and
by which speech is expressed that alone know as Brahman, not that
which people here adore.' The remark that the statement about the
difference of pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a and praj<i>&ntilde;</i>&acirc;
(contained in the passage, 'Together they dwell in this body,
together they depart') does not agree with that interpretation
according to which pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a is Brahman, is without force;
for the mind and the vital air which are the respective abodes of
the two powers of cognition and action, and constitute the limiting
conditions of the internal Self may be spoken of as different. The
internal Self, on the other hand, which is limited by those two
adjuncts, is in itself non-differentiated, so that the two may be
identified, as is done in the passage 'pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a is
praj<i>&ntilde;</i>&acirc;.'</p>
<p>The second part of the S&ucirc;tra is explained in a different
manner also<a id="footnotetag134" name=
"footnotetag134"></a><a href="#footnote134"><sup>134</sup></a>, as
follows: Characteristic marks of the individual soul as well as of
the chief vital air are not out of place even in a chapter whose
topic is Brahman. How so? 'On account of the threefoldness of
devout meditation.' The chapter aims at enjoining three kinds of
devout meditation on Brahman, according as Brahman is viewed under
the aspect of pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a, under the aspect of
praj<i>&ntilde;</i>&acirc;, and in itself. The passages, 'Meditate
(on me) as life, as immortality. Life is pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a,' and
'Having laid hold of this body it makes it rise up. Therefore let
man worship it alone as uktha,' refer to the pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a
aspect. The introductory passage, 'Now we shall explain how all
things become one in that praj<i>&ntilde;</i>&acirc;,' and the
subsequent passages, 'Speech verily milked one portion thereof; the
word is its object placed outside;' and, 'Having by
praj<i>&ntilde;</i>&acirc; taken possession of speech he obtains by
speech all words &amp;c.,' refer to the praj<i>&ntilde;</i>&acirc;
aspect. The Brahman aspect finally is referred to in the following
passage, 'These ten <span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id=
"page106"></a>{106}</span> objects have reference to
praj<i>&ntilde;</i>&acirc;, the ten subjects have reference to
objects. If there were no objects there would be no subjects; and
if there were no subjects there would be no objects. For on either
side alone nothing could be achieved. But that is not many. For as
in a car the circumference of the wheel is set on the spokes and
the spokes on the nave, thus are these objects set on the subjects
and the subjects on the pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a.' Thus we see that the
one meditation on Brahman is here represented as threefold,
according as Brahman is viewed either with reference to two
limiting conditions or in itself. In other passages also we find
that devout meditation on Brahman is made dependent on Brahman
being qualified by limiting adjuncts; so, for instance (Ch. Up.
III, 14, 2), 'He who consists of mind, whose body is
pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a.' The hypothesis of Brahman being meditated upon
under three aspects perfectly agrees with the pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a
chapter<a id="footnotetag135" name="footnotetag135"></a><a href=
"#footnote135"><sup>135</sup></a>; as, on the one hand, from a
comparison of the introductory and the concluding clauses we infer
that the subject-matter of the whole chapter is one only, and as,
on the other hand, we meet with characteristic marks of
pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a, praj<i>&ntilde;</i>&acirc;, and Brahman in
turns. It therefore remains a settled conclusion that Brahman is
the topic of the whole chapter.</p>

<p>The above discussion of the prohibitory passages of the Veda is
of a very scholastic nature, and various clauses in it are
differently interpreted by the different commentators.
<i>S</i>a@nkara endeavours to fortify his doctrine, that not all
parts of the Veda refer to action by an appeal to prohibitory
passages which do not enjoin action but abstinence from action. The
legitimacy of this appeal might be contested on the ground that a
prohibitory passage also, (as, for instance, 'a
br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a is not to be killed,') can be explained as
enjoining a positive action, viz. some action opposed in nature to
the one forbidden, so that the quoted passage might be interpreted
to mean 'a determination, &amp;c. of not killing a
br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a is to be formed;' just as we understand
something positive by the expression 'a non-br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a,'
viz. some man who is a kshattriya or something else. To this the
answer is that, wherever we can, we must attribute to the word
'not' its primary sense which is the absolute negation of the word
to which it is joined; so that passages where it is joined to words
denoting action must be considered to have for their purport the
entire absence of action. Special cases only are excepted, as the
one alluded to in the text where certain prohibited actions are
enumerated under the heading of vows; for as a vow is considered as
something positive, the non-doing of some particular action must
there be understood as intimating the performance of some action of
an opposite nature. The question as to the various meanings of the
particle 'not' is discussed in all treatises on the
P&ucirc;rv&acirc; M&icirc;m&acirc;<i>m</i>s&acirc;; see, for
instance, Arthasamgraha, translation, p. 39 ff.</p>

<h4>SECOND P&Acirc;DA.</h4>
<center>REVERENCE TO THE HIGHEST SELF!</center>
<p>In the first p&acirc;da Brahman has been shown to be the cause
of the origin, subsistence, and reabsorption of the entire world,
comprising the ether and the other elements. Moreover, of this
Brahman, which is the cause of the entire world, certain qualities
have (implicitly) been declared, such as all-pervadingness,
eternity, omniscience, its being the Self of all, and so on.
Further, by producing reasons showing that some words which are
generally used in a different sense denote Brahman also, we have
been able to determine that some passages about whose sense doubts
are entertained refer to Brahman. Now certain other passages
present themselves which because containing only obscure
indications of Brahman give rise to the doubt whether they refer to
the highest Self or to something else. We therefore begin the
second and third p&acirc;das in order to settle those doubtful
points.</p>
<p>1. (That which consists of mind is Brahman) because there is
taught what is known from everywhere.</p>
<p>Scripture says, 'All this indeed is Brahman, beginning, ending,
and breathing in it; thus knowing let a man meditate with calm
mind. Now man is made of determination (kratu); according to what
his determination is in this world so will he be when he has
departed this life. Let him therefore form this determination: he
who consists of mind, whose body is breath (the subtle body),'
&amp;c. (Ch. Up. III, 14). Concerning this passage the doubt
presents itself whether what is pointed out as the object of
meditation, by means of attributes such as consisting of mind,
&amp;c., is the embodied (individual) soul or the highest
Brahman.</p>
<p>The embodied Self, the p&ucirc;rvapakshin
says.&mdash;Why?&mdash;Because the embodied Self as the ruler of
the organs of action is well known to be connected with the mind
and so on, while the highest Brahman is not, as is declared in
several scriptural passages, so, for instance (Mu. Up. II, 1, 2),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id=
"page108"></a>{108}</span> 'He is without breath, without mind,
pure.'&mdash;But, it may be objected, the passage, 'All this indeed
is Brahman,' mentions Brahman directly; how then can you suppose
that the embodied Self forms the object of meditation?&mdash;This
objection does not apply, the p&ucirc;rvapakshin rejoins, because
the passage does not aim at enjoining meditation on Brahman, but
rather at enjoining calmness of mind, the sense being: because
Brahman is all this, tajjal&acirc;n, let a man meditate with a calm
mind. That is to say: because all this aggregate of effects is
Brahman only, springing from it, ending in it, and breathing in it;
and because, as everything constitutes one Self only, there is no
room for passion; therefore a man is to meditate with a calm mind.
And since the sentence aims at enjoining calmness of mind, it
cannot at the same time enjoin meditation on Brahman<a id=
"footnotetag136" name="footnotetag136"></a><a href=
"#footnote136"><sup>136</sup></a>; but meditation is separately
enjoined in the clause, 'Let him form the determination, i.e.
reflection.' And thereupon the subsequent passage, 'He who consists
of mind, whose body is breath,' &amp;c. states the object of the
meditation in words indicatory of the individual soul. For this
reason we maintain that the meditation spoken of has the individual
soul for its object. The other attributes also subsequently stated
in the text, 'He to whom all works, all desires belong,' &amp;c.
may rightly be held to refer to the individual soul. The
attributes, finally, of being what abides in the heart and of being
extremely minute which are mentioned in the passage, 'He is my Self
within the heart, smaller than a corn of rice, smaller than a corn
of barley,' may be ascribed to the individual soul which has the
size of the point of a goad, but not to the unlimited Brahman. If
it be objected that the immediately following passage, 'greater
than the earth,' &amp;c., cannot refer to something limited, we
reply that smallness and greatness which are mutually opposite
cannot indeed be ascribed to one and the same thing; and that, if
one attribute <span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id=
"page109"></a>{109}</span> only is to be ascribed to the subject of
the passage, smallness is preferable because it is mentioned first;
while the greatness mentioned later on may be attributed to the
soul in so far as it is one with Brahman. If it is once settled
that the whole passage refers to the individual soul, it follows
that the declaration of Brahman also, contained in the passage,
'That is Brahman' (III, 14, 4), refers to the individual soul<a id=
"footnotetag137" name="footnotetag137"></a><a href=
"#footnote137"><sup>137</sup></a>, as it is clearly connected with
the general topic. Therefore the individual soul is the object of
meditation indicated by the qualities of consisting of mind and so
on.</p>
<p>To all this we reply: The highest Brahman only is what is to be
meditated upon as distinguished by the attributes of consisting of
mind and so on.&mdash;Why?&mdash;'On account of there being taught
here what is known from everywhere.' What is known from all
Ved&acirc;nta-passages to be the sense of the word Brahman, viz.
the cause of the world, and what is mentioned here in the beginning
words of the passage, ('all this indeed is Brahman,') the same we
must assume to be taught here as distinguished by certain
qualities, viz. consisting of mind and so on. Thus we avoid the
fault of dropping the subject-matter under discussion and
needlessly introducing a new topic.&mdash;But, it may be said, it
has been shown that Brahman is, in the beginning of the passage,
introduced merely for the purpose of intimating the injunction of
calmness of mind, not for the purpose of intimating Brahman
itself.&mdash;True, we reply; but the fact nevertheless remains
that, where the qualities of consisting of mind, &amp;c. are spoken
of, Brahman only is proximate (i.e. mentioned not far off so that
it may be concluded to be the thing referred to), while the
individual soul is neither proximate nor intimated by any word
directly pointing to it. The cases of Brahman and the individual
soul are therefore not equal.</p>
<p>2. And because the qualities desired to be expressed are
possible (in Brahman; therefore the passage refers to Brahman).</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id=
"page110"></a>{110}</span>
<p>Although in the Veda which is not the work of man no wish in the
strict sense can be expressed<a id="footnotetag138" name=
"footnotetag138"></a><a href="#footnote138"><sup>138</sup></a>,
there being no speaker, still such phrases as 'desired to be
expressed,' may be figuratively used on account of the result, viz.
(mental) comprehension. For just as in ordinary language we speak
of something which is intimated by a word and is to be received (by
the hearer as the meaning of the word), as 'desired to be
expressed;' so in the Veda also whatever is denoted as that which
is to be received is 'desired to be expressed,' everything else
'not desired to be expressed.' What is to be received as the
meaning of a Vedic sentence, and what not, is inferred from the
general purport of the passage. Those qualities which are here
desired to be expressed, i.e. intimated as qualities to be dwelt on
in meditation, viz. the qualities of having true purposes, &amp;c.
are possible in the highest Brahman; for the quality of having true
purposes may be ascribed to the highest Self which possesses
unimpeded power over the creation, subsistence, and reabsorption of
this world. Similarly the qualities of having true desires and true
purposes are attributed to the highest Self in another passage,
viz. the one beginning, 'The Self which is free from sin' (Ch. Up.
VIII, 7, 1). The clause, 'He whose Self is the ether,' means 'he
whose Self is like the ether;' for Brahman may be said to be like
the ether on account of its omnipresence and other qualities. This
is also expressed by the clause, 'Greater than the earth.' And the
other explanation also, according to which the passage means 'he
whose Self is the ether' is possible, since Brahman which as the
cause of the whole world is the Self of everything is also the Self
of the ether. For the same reasons he is called 'he to whom all
works belong, and so on.' Thus the qualities here intimated as
topics of meditation agree with the nature of Brahman. We further
maintain that the terms 'consisting of mind,' and 'having breath
for its body,' which the p&ucirc;rvapakshin asserts <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>{111}</span> cannot
refer to Brahman, may refer to it. For as Brahman is the Self of
everything, qualities such as consisting of mind and the like,
which belong to the individual soul, belong to Brahman also.
Accordingly <i>S</i>ruti and Sm<i>ri</i>ti say of Brahman, 'Thou
art woman, thou art man; thou art youth, thou art maiden; thou as
an old man totterest along on thy staff; thou art born with thy
face turned everywhere' (<i>S</i>ve. Up. IV, 3), and 'its hands and
feet are everywhere, its eyes and head are everywhere, its ears are
everywhere, it stands encompassing all in the world' (Bha.
G&icirc;t&acirc; III, 13).</p>
<p>The passage (quoted above against our view), 'Without breath,
without mind, pure,' refers to the pure (unrelated) Brahman. The
terms 'consisting of mind; having breath for its body,' on the
other hand, refer to Brahman as distinguished by qualities. Hence,
as the qualities mentioned are possible in Brahman, we conclude
that the highest Brahman only is represented as the object of
meditation.</p>
<p>3. On the other hand, as (those qualities) are not possible (in
it), the embodied (soul is) not (denoted by manomaya, &amp;c.).</p>
<p>The preceding S&ucirc;tra has declared that the qualities
mentioned are possible in Brahman; the present S&ucirc;tra states
that they are not possible in the embodied Self. Brahman only
possesses, in the manner explained, the qualities of consisting of
mind, and so on; not the embodied individual soul. For qualities
such as expressed in the words, 'He whose purposes are true, whose
Self is the ether, who has no speech, who is not disturbed, who is
greater than the earth,' cannot easily be attributed to the
embodied Self. By the term 'embodied' (<i>s</i>&acirc;r&icirc;ra)
we have to understand 'residing' in a body. If it be objected that
the Lord also resides in the body<a id="footnotetag139" name=
"footnotetag139"></a><a href="#footnote139"><sup>139</sup></a>, we
reply, True, he does reside in the body, but not in the body only;
for <i>s</i>ruti declares him to be all-pervading; compare, 'He is
greater than the earth; greater than the atmosphere, omnipresent
like the ether, eternal.' The individual soul, on the other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id=
"page112"></a>{112}</span> hand, is in the body only, apart from
which as the abode of fruition it does not exist.</p>
<p>4. And because there is a (separate) denotation of the object of
activity and of the agent.</p>
<p>The attributes of consisting of mind, and so on, cannot belong
to the embodied Self for that reason also, that there is a
(separate) denotation of the object of activity and of the agent.
In the passage, 'When I shall have departed from hence I shall
obtain him' (Ch. Up. III, 14, 4), the word 'him' refers to that
which is the topic of discussion, viz. the Self which is to be
meditated upon as possessing the attributes of consisting of mind,
&amp;c., as the object of an activity, viz. as something to be
obtained; while the words, 'I shall obtain,' represent the
meditating individual Self as the agent, i.e. the obtainer. Now,
wherever it can be helped, we must not assume that one and the same
being is spoken of as the agent and the object of the activity at
the same time. The relation existing between a person meditating
and the thing meditated upon requires, moreover, different
abodes.&mdash;And thus for the above reason, also, that which is
characterised by the attributes of consisting of mind, and so on,
cannot be the individual soul.</p>
<p>5. On account of the difference of words.</p>
<p>That which possesses the attributes of consisting of mind, and
so on, cannot be the individual soul, for that reason also that
there is a difference of words.</p>
<p>That is to say, we meet with another scriptural passage of
kindred subject-matter (<i>S</i>at. Br&acirc;. X, 6, 3, 2), 'Like a
rice grain, or a barley grain, or a canary seed or the kernel of a
canary seed, thus that golden person is in the Self.' There one
word, i.e. the locative 'in the Self,' denotes the embodied Self,
and a different word, viz. the nominative 'person,' denotes the
Self distinguished by the qualities of consisting of mind, &amp;c.
We therefrom conclude that the two are different.</p>
<p>6. And on account of Sm<i>ri</i>ti.</p>
<p>Sm<i>ri</i>ti also declares the difference of the embodied Self
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id=
"page113"></a>{113}</span> and the highest Self, viz. Bha.
G&icirc;t&acirc; XVIII, 61, 'The Lord, O Arjuna, is seated in the
heart of all beings, driving round by his magical power all beings
(as if they were) mounted on a machine.'</p>
<p>But what, it may be asked, is that so-called embodied Self
different from the highest Self which is to be set aside according
to the preceding S&ucirc;tras? <i>S</i>ruti passages, as well as
Sm<i>ri</i>ti, expressly deny that there is any Self apart from the
highest Self; compare, for instance, B<i>ri</i>. Up. III, 7, 23,
'There is no other seer but he; there is no other hearer but he;'
and Bha. G&icirc;t&acirc; XIII, 2, 'And know me also, O
Bh&acirc;rata, to be the kshetiaj<i>&ntilde;</i>a in all
kshetras.'</p>
<p>True, we reply, (there is in reality one universal Self only.)
But the highest Self in so far as it is limited by its adjuncts,
viz. the body, the senses, and the mind (mano-buddhi), is, by the
ignorant, spoken of as if it were embodied. Similarly the ether,
although in reality unlimited, appears limited owing to certain
adjuncts, such as jars and other vessels. With regard to this
(unreal limitation of the one Self) the distinction of objects of
activity and of agents may be practically assumed, as long as we
have not learned&mdash;from the passage, 'That art thou'&mdash;that
the Self is one only. As soon, however, as we grasp the truth that
there is only one universal Self, there is an end to the whole
practical view of the world with its distinction of bondage, final
release, and the like.</p>
<p>7. If it be said that (the passage does) not (refer to Brahman)
on account of the smallness of the abode (mentioned), and on
account of the denotations of that (i.e. of minuteness); we say,
no; because (Brahman) has thus to be contemplated, and because the
case is analogous to that of ether.</p>
<p>On account of the limitation of its abode, which is mentioned in
the clause, 'He is my Self within the heart,' and on account of the
declaration as to its minuteness contained in the direct statement,
'He is smaller than a grain of rice,' &amp;c.; the embodied soul
only, which is of the size of an awl's point, is spoken of in the
passage under discussion, and not <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page114" id="page114"></a>{114}</span> the highest Self. This
assertion made above (in the p&ucirc;rvapaksha of S&ucirc;tra I,
and restated in the p&ucirc;rvapaksha of the present S&ucirc;tra)
has to be refuted. We therefore maintain that the objection raised
does not invalidate our view of the passage. It is true that a
thing occupying a limited space only cannot in any way be spoken of
as omnipresent; but, on the other hand, that which is omnipresent,
and therefore in all places may, from a certain point of view, be
said to occupy a limited space. Similarly, a prince may be called
the ruler of Ayodhy&acirc; although he is at the same time the
ruler of the whole earth.&mdash;But from what point of view can the
omnipresent Lord be said to occupy a limited space and to be
minute?&mdash;He may, we reply, be spoken of thus, 'because he is
to be contemplated thus.' The passage under discussion teaches us
to contemplate the Lord as abiding within the lotus of the heart,
characterised by minuteness and similar qualities&mdash;which
apprehension of the Lord is rendered possible through a
modification of the mind&mdash;just as Hari is contemplated in the
sacred stone called <i>S</i>&acirc;lagr&acirc;m. Although present
everywhere, the Lord is pleased when meditated upon as dwelling in
the heart. The case is, moreover, to be viewed as analogous to that
of the ether. The ether, although all-pervading, is spoken of as
limited and minute, if considered in its connexion with the eye of
a needle; so Brahman also. But it is an understood matter that the
attributes of limitation of abode and of minuteness depend, in
Brahman's case, entirely on special forms of contemplation, and are
not real. The latter consideration disposes also of the objection,
that if Brahman has its abode in the heart, which heart-abode is a
different one in each body, it would follow that it is affected by
all the imperfections which attach to beings having different
abodes, such as parrots shut up in different cages, viz. want of
unity, being made up of parts, non-permanency, and so on.</p>
<p>8. If it is said that (from the circumstance of Brahman and the
individual soul being one) there follows fruition (on the part of
Brahman); we say, no; on account of the difference of nature (of
the two).</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id=
"page115"></a>{115}</span>
<p>But, it may be said, as Brahman is omnipresent like ether, and
therefore connected with the hearts of all living beings, and as it
is of the nature of intelligence and therefore not different from
the individual soul, it follows that Brahman also has the same
fruition of pleasure, pain, and so on (as the individual soul). The
same result follows from its unity. For in reality there exists no
transmigratory Self different from the highest Self; as appears
from the text, 'There is no other knower but he' (B<i>ri</i>. Up.
III, 7, 23), and similar passages. Hence the highest Self is
subject to the fruition connected with transmigratory
existence.</p>
<p>This is not so, we reply; because there is a difference of
nature. From the circumstance that Brahman is connected with the
hearts of all living beings it does not follow that it is, like the
embodied Self, subject to fruition. For, between the embodied Self
and the highest Self, there is the difference that the former acts
and enjoys, acquires merit and demerit, and is affected by
pleasure, pain, and so on; while the latter is of the opposite
nature, i.e. characterised by being free from all evil and the
like. On account of this difference of the two, the fruition of the
one does not extend to the other. To assume merely on the ground of
the mutual proximity of the two, without considering their
essentially different powers, that a connexion with effects exists
(in Brahman's case also), would be no better than to suppose that
space is on fire (when something in space is on fire). The same
objection and refutation apply to the case of those also who teach
the existence of more than one omnipresent Self. In reply to the
assertion, that because Brahman is one and there are no other Selfs
outside it, Brahman must be subject to fruition since the
individual soul is so, we ask the question: How have you, our wise
opponent, ascertained that there is no other Self? You will reply,
we suppose, from scriptural texts such as, 'That art thou,' 'I am
Brahman,' 'There is no other knower but he,' and so on. Very well,
then, it appears that the truth about scriptural matters is to be
ascertained from Scripture, and that Scripture is not sometimes to
be appealed to, and on other occasions to be disregarded.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id=
"page116"></a>{116}</span>
<p>Scriptural texts, such as 'that art thou,' teach that Brahman
which is free from all evil is the Self of the embodied soul, and
thus dispel even the opinion that the embodied soul is subject to
fruition; how then should fruition on the part of the embodied soul
involve fruition on the part of Brahman?&mdash;Let, then, the unity
of the individual soul and Brahman not be apprehended on the ground
of Scripture.&mdash;In that case, we reply, the fruition on the
part of the individual soul has wrong knowledge for its cause, and
Brahman as it truly exists is not touched thereby, not any more
than the ether becomes really dark-blue in consequence of ignorant
people presuming it to be so. For this reason the
S&ucirc;trak&acirc;ra says<a id="footnotetag140" name=
"footnotetag140"></a><a href="#footnote140"><sup>140</sup></a> 'no,
on account of the difference.' In spite of their unity, fruition on
the part of the soul does not involve fruition on the part of
Brahman; because there is a difference. For there is a difference
between false knowledge and perfect knowledge, fruition being the
figment of false knowledge while the unity (of the Self) is
revealed by perfect knowledge. Now, as the substance revealed by
perfect knowledge cannot be affected by fruition which is nothing
but the figment of false knowledge, it is impossible to assume even
a shadow of fruition on Brahman's part.</p>
<p>9. The eater (is the highest Self) since what is movable and
what is immovable is mentioned (as his food).</p>
<p>We read in the Ka<i>th</i>avall&icirc; (I, 2, 25), 'Who then
knows where He is, He to whom the Brahmans and Kshattriyas are but
food, and death itself a condiment?' This passage intimates, by
means of the words 'food' and 'condiment,' that there is some
eater. A doubt then arises whether the eater be Agni or the
individual soul or the highest Self; for no distinguishing
characteristic is stated, and Agni as well as the individual soul
and the highest Self is observed to form, in that Upanishad, the
subjects of questions<a id="footnotetag141" name=
"footnotetag141"></a><a href="#footnote141"><sup>141</sup></a>.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id=
"page117"></a>{117}</span>
<p>The p&ucirc;rvapakshin maintains that the eater is Agni, fire
being known from Scripture as well (cp. B<i>ri</i>. Up. I, 4, 6) as
from ordinary life to be the eater of food. Or else the individual
soul may be the eater, according to the passage, 'One of them eats
the sweet fruit' (Mu. Up. III, 1, 1). On the other hand, the eater
cannot be Brahman on account of the passage (which forms the
continuation of the one quoted from the Mu. Up.), 'The other looks
on without eating.'</p>
<p>The eater, we reply, must be the highest Self 'because there is
mentioned what is movable and what is immovable.' For all things
movable and immovable are here to be taken as constituting the
food, while death is the condiment. But nothing beside the highest
Self can be the consumer of all these things in their totality; the
highest Self, however, when reabsorbing the entire aggregate of
effects may be said to eat everything. If it is objected that here
no express mention is made of things movable and things immovable,
and that hence we have no right to use the (alleged) mention made
of them as a reason, we reply that this objection is unfounded;
firstly, because the aggregate of all living beings is seen to be
meant from the circumstance of death being the condiment; and,
secondly, because the Brahmans and Kshattriyas may here, on account
of their pre-eminent position, be viewed as instances only (of all
beings). Concerning the objection that the highest Self cannot be
an eater on account of the passage quoted ('the other looks on
without eating'), we remark that that passage aims at denying the
fruition (on the part of the highest Self) of the results of works,
such fruition being mentioned in immediate proximity, but is not
meant to negative the reabsorption of the world of effects (into
Brahman); for it is well established by all the Ved&acirc;nta-texts
that Brahman is the cause of the creation, subsistence, and
reabsorption of the world. Therefore the eater can here be Brahman
only.</p>
<p>10. And on account of the topic under discussion. That the
highest Self only can be the eater referred to <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>{118}</span> is
moreover evident from the passage (Ka. Up. I, 2, 18), ('The knowing
Self is not born, it dies not'), which shows that the highest Self
is the general topic. And to adhere to the general topic is the
proper proceeding. Further, the clause, 'Who then knows where he
is,' shows that the cognition is connected with difficulties; which
circumstance again points to the highest Self.</p>
<p>11. The 'two entered into the cave' (are the individual soul and
the highest Self), for the two are (intelligent) Selfs (and
therefore of the same nature), as it is seen (that numerals denote
beings of the same nature).</p>
<p>In the same Ka<i>th</i>avall&icirc; we read (I, 3, 1), 'There
are the two drinking the reward of their works in the world, (i.e.
the body,) entered into the cave, dwelling on the highest summit.
Those who know Brahman call them shade and light; likewise those
householders who perform the Tri<i>n</i>&acirc;<i>k</i>iketa
sacrifice.'</p>
<p>Here the doubt arises whether the mind (buddhi) and the
individual soul are referred to, or the individual soul and the
highest Self. If the mind and the individual soul, then the
individual soul is here spoken of as different from the aggregate
of the organs of action, (i.e. the body,) among which the mind
occupies the first place. And a statement on this point is to be
expected, as a question concerning it is asked in a preceding
passage, viz. I, 1, 20, 'There is that doubt when a man is
dead&mdash;some saying he is; others, he is not. This I should like
to know taught by thee; this is the third of my boons.' If, on the
other hand, the passage refers to the individual soul and the
highest Self, then it intimates that the highest Self is different
from the individual soul; and this also requires to be declared
here, on account of the question contained in the passage (I, 2,
14), 'That which thou seest as different from religious duty and
its contrary, from effect and cause, from the past and the future,
tell me that.'</p>
<p>The doubt to which the passage gives rise having thus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id=
"page119"></a>{119}</span> been stated, a caviller starts the
following objection: neither of the stated views can be
maintained.&mdash;Why?&mdash;On account of the characteristic mark
implied in the circumstance that the two are said to drink, i.e. to
enjoy, the fruit of their works in the world. For this can apply to
the intelligent individual soul only, not to the non-intelligent
buddhi. And as the dual form 'drinking' (pibantau) shows that both
are drinking, the view of the two being the buddhi and the
individual soul is not tenable. For the same reason the other
opinion also, viz. of the two being the individual soul and the
highest Self, cannot be maintained; for drinking (i.e. the fruition
of reward) cannot be predicated of the highest Self, on account of
the mantra (Mu. Up. III, 1, 1), 'The other looks on without
eating.'</p>
<p>These objections, we reply, are without any force. Just as we
see that in phrases such as 'the men with the umbrella (lit. the
umbrella-men) are walking,' the attribute of being furnished with
an umbrella which properly speaking belongs to one man only is
secondarily ascribed to many, so here two agents are spoken of as
drinking because one of them is really drinking. Or else we may
explain the passage by saying that, while the individual soul only
drinks, the Lord also is said to drink because he makes the soul
drink. On the other hand, we may also assume that the two are the
buddhi and the individual soul, the instrument being figuratively
spoken of as the agent&mdash;a figure of speech exemplified by
phrases such as 'the fuel cooks (the food).' And in a chapter whose
topic is the soul no two other beings can well be represented as
enjoying rewards. Hence there is room for the doubt whether the two
are the buddhi and the individual soul, or the individual soul and
the highest Self.</p>
<p>Here the p&ucirc;rvapakshin maintains that the former of the two
stated views is the right one, because the two beings are qualified
as 'entered into the cave.' Whether we understand by the cave the
body or the heart, in either case the buddhi and the individual
soul may be spoken of as 'entered into the cave.' Nor would it be
appropriate, as long as another interpretation is possible, to
assume <span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id=
"page120"></a>{120}</span> that a special place is here ascribed to
the omnipresent Brahman. Moreover, the words 'in the world of their
good deeds' show that the two do not pass beyond the sphere of the
results of their good works. But the highest Self is not in the
sphere of the results of either good or bad works; according to the
scriptural passage, 'It does not grow larger by works nor does it
grow smaller.' Further, the words 'shade and light' properly
designate what is intelligent and what is non-intelligent, because
the two are opposed to each other like light and shade. Hence we
conclude that the buddhi and the individual soul are spoken of.</p>
<p>To this we make the following reply:&mdash;In the passage under
discussion the individual soul
(vij<i>&ntilde;</i>&acirc;n&acirc;tman) and the highest Self are
spoken of, because these two, being both intelligent Selfs, are of
the same nature. For we see that in ordinary life also, whenever a
number is mentioned, beings of the same class are understood to be
meant; when, for instance, the order is given, 'Look out for a
second (i.e. a fellow) for this bull,' people look out for a second
bull, not for a horse or a man. So here also, where the mention of
the fruition of rewards enables us to determine that the individual
soul is meant, we understand at once, when a second is required,
that the highest Self has to be understood; for the highest Self is
intelligent, and therefore of the same nature as the
soul.&mdash;But has it not been said above that the highest Self
cannot be meant here, on account of the text stating that it is
placed in the cave?&mdash;Well, we reply, <i>s</i>ruti as well as
sm<i>ri</i>ti speaks of the highest Self as placed in the cave.
Compare, for instance (Ka. Up. I, 2, 12), 'The Ancient who is
hidden in the cave, who dwells in the abyss;' Taitt. Up. II, 1, 'He
who knows him hidden in the cave, in the highest ether;' and,
'Search for the Self entered into the cave.' That it is not
contrary to reason to assign to the omnipresent Brahman a special
locality, for the purpose of clearer perception, we have already
demonstrated. The attribute of existing in the world of its good
works, which properly belongs to one of the two only, viz. to the
individual soul, may be assigned to both, analogously to the case
of the men, one of whom carries an umbrella. Their being compared
to light <span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id=
"page121"></a>{121}</span> and shade also is unobjectionable,
because the qualities of belonging and not belonging to this
transmigratory world are opposed to each other, like light and
shade; the quality of belonging to it being due to Nescience, and
the quality of not belonging to it being real. We therefore
understand by the two 'entered into the cave,' the individual soul
and the highest Self.&mdash;Another reason for this interpretation
follows.</p>
<p>12. And on account of the distinctive qualities (mentioned).</p>
<p>Moreover, the distinctive qualities mentioned in the text agree
only with the individual Self and the highest Self. For in a
subsequent passage (I, 3, 3), 'Know the Self to be the charioteer,
the body to be the chariot,' which contains the simile of the
chariot, the individual soul is represented as a charioteer driving
on through transmigratory existence and final release, while the
passage (9), 'He reaches the end of his journey, and that is the
highest place of Vish<i>n</i>u,' represents the highest Self as the
goal of the driver's course. And in a preceding passage also, (I,
2, 12, 'The wise, who by means of meditation on his Self,
recognises the Ancient who is difficult to be seen, who has entered
into the dark, who is hidden in the cave, who dwells in the abyss,
as God, he indeed leaves joy and sorrow far behind,') the same two
beings are distinguished as thinker and as object of thought. The
highest Self is, moreover, the general topic. And further, the
clause, 'Those who know Brahman call them,' &amp;c., which brings
forward a special class of speakers, is in its place only if the
highest Self is accepted (as one of the two beings spoken of). It
is therefore evident that the passage under discussion refers to
the individual soul and the highest Self.</p>
<p>The same reasoning applies to the passage (Mu. Up. III, 1, 1),
'Two birds, inseparable friends,' &amp;c. There also the Self is
the general topic, and hence no two ordinary birds can be meant; we
therefore conclude from the characteristic mark of eating,
mentioned in the passage, 'One of them eats the sweet fruit,' that
the individual soul is meant, and from <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>{122}</span> the
characteristic marks of abstinence from eating and of intelligence,
implied in the words, 'The other looks on without eating,' that the
highest Self is meant. In a subsequent mantra again the two are
distinguished as the seer and the object of sight. 'Merged into the
same tree (as it were into water) man grieves at his own impotence
(an&icirc;<i>s</i>&acirc;), bewildered; but when he sees the other
Lord (&icirc;<i>s</i>a.) contented and knows his glory, then his
grief passes away.'</p>
<p>Another (commentator) gives a different interpretation of the
mantra, 'Two birds inseparable,' &amp;c. To that mantra, he says,
the final decision of the present head of discussion does not
apply, because it is differently interpreted in the Pai@ngi-rahasya
br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a. According to the latter the being which eats
the sweet fruit is the sattva; the other being which looks on
without eating, the individual soul (j<i>&ntilde;</i>a); so that
the two are the sattva and the individual soul
(kshetraj<i>&ntilde;</i>a). The objection that the word sattva
might denote the individual soul, and the word
kshetraj<i>&ntilde;</i>a, the highest Self, is to be met by the
remark that, in the first place, the words sattva and
kshetraj<i>&ntilde;</i>a have the settled meaning of internal organ
and individual soul, and are in the second place, expressly so
interpreted there, (viz. in the Pai@ngi-rahasya,) 'The sattva is
that by means of which man sees dreams; the embodied one, the seer,
is the kshetraj<i>&ntilde;</i>a; the two are therefore the internal
organ and the individual soul.' Nor does the mantra under
discussion fall under the p&ucirc;rvapaksha propounded above. For
it does not aim at setting forth the embodied individual soul, in
so far as it is characterised by the attributes connected with the
transmigratory state, such as acting and enjoying; but in so far
rather as it transcends all attributes connected with the
sa<i>m</i>s&acirc;ra and is of the nature of Brahman, i.e. is pure
intelligence; as is evident from the clause, 'The other looks on
without eating.' That agrees, moreover, with <i>s</i>ruti and
sm<i>ri</i>ti passages, such as, 'That art thou,' and 'Know me also
to be the individual soul' (Bha. G&icirc;t&acirc; XIII, 2). Only on
such an explanation of the passage as the preceding one there is
room for the declaration made in the concluding passage of the
section, 'These two are the sattva and the
kshetraj<i>&ntilde;</i>a; to him indeed <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>{123}</span> who knows
this no impurity attaches<a id="footnotetag142" name=
"footnotetag142"></a><a href=
"#footnote142"><sup>142</sup></a>.'&mdash;But how can, on the above
interpretation, the non-intelligent sattva (i.e. the internal
organ) be spoken of as an enjoyer, as is actually done in the
clause, 'One of them eats the sweet fruit?'&mdash;The whole
passage, we reply, does not aim at setting forth the fact that the
sattva is an enjoyer, but rather the fact that the intelligent
individual soul is not an enjoyer, but is of the nature of Brahman.
To that end<a id="footnotetag143" name=
"footnotetag143"></a><a href="#footnote143"><sup>143</sup></a> the
passage under discussion metaphorically ascribes the attribute of
being an enjoyer to the internal organ, in so far as it is modified
by pleasure, pain, and the like. For all acting and enjoying is at
the bottom based on the non-discrimination (by the soul) of the
respective nature of internal organ and soul: while in reality
neither the internal organ nor the soul either act or enjoy; not
the former, because it is non-intelligent; not the latter, because
it is not capable of any modification. And the internal organ can
be considered as acting and enjoying, all the less as it is a mere
presentment of Nescience. In agreement with what we have here
maintained, Scripture ('For where there is as it were duality there
one sees the other,' &amp;c.; B<i>ri</i>. Up. IV, 5, 15) declares
that the practical assumption of agents, and so on&mdash;comparable
to the assumption of the existence of elephants, and the like, seen
in a dream&mdash;holds good in the sphere of Nescience only; while
the passage, 'But when the Self only is all this, how should he see
another?' declares that all that practically postulated existence
vanishes for him who has arrived at discriminative knowledge.</p>
<p>13. The person within (the eye) (is Brahman) on account of the
agreement (of the attributes of that person with the nature of
Brahman).</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id=
"page124"></a>{124}</span>
<p>Scripture says, 'He spoke: The person that is seen in the eye
that is the Self. This is the immortal, the fearless, this is
Brahman. Even though they drop melted butter or water on it (the
eye) it runs away on both sides,' &amp;c. (Ch. Up. IV, 15, 1).</p>
<p>The doubt here arises whether this passage refers to the
reflected Self which resides in the eye, or to the individual Self,
or to the Self of some deity which presides over the sense of
sight, or to the Lord.</p>
<p>With reference to this doubt the p&ucirc;rvapakshin argues as
follows: What is meant (by the person in the eye) is the reflected
Self, i.e. the image of a person (reflected in the eye of another):
for of that it is well known that it is seen, and the clause, 'The
person that is seen in the eye,' refers to it as something well
known. Or else we may appropriately take the passage as referring
to the individual Self. For the individual Self (cognitional Self,
vij<i>&ntilde;</i>&acirc;n&acirc;tman) which perceives the colours
by means of the eye is, on that account, in proximity to the eye;
and, moreover, the word 'Self' (which occurs in the passage)
favours this interpretation. Or else the passage is to be
understood as referring to the soul animating the sun which assists
the sense of sight; compare the passage (B<i>ri</i>. Up. V, 5, 2),
'He (the person in the sun) rests with his rays in him (the person
in the right eye).' Moreover, qualities such as immortality and the
like (which are ascribed to the subject of the scriptural passage)
may somehow belong to individual deities. The Lord, on the other
hand<a id="footnotetag144" name="footnotetag144"></a><a href=
"#footnote144"><sup>144</sup></a>, cannot be meant, because a
particular locality is spoken of.</p>
<p>Against this we remark that the highest Lord only can be meant
here by the person within the eye.&mdash;Why?&mdash;'On account of
the agreement.' For the qualities mentioned in the passage accord
with the nature of the highest Lord. The quality of being the Self,
in the first place, belongs to the highest Lord in its primary
(non-figurative or non-derived) sense, as we know from such texts
as 'That <span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id=
"page125"></a>{125}</span> is the Self,' 'That art thou.'
Immortality and fearlessness again are often ascribed to him in
Scripture. The location in the eye also is in consonance with the
nature of the highest Lord. For just as the highest Lord whom
Scripture declares to be free from all evil is not stained by any
imperfections, so the station of the eye also is declared to be
free from all stain, as we see from the passage, 'Even though they
drop melted butter or water on it it runs away on both sides.' The
statement, moreover, that he possesses the qualities of
sa<i>m</i>yadv&acirc;ma, &amp;c. can be reconciled with the highest
Lord only (Ch. Up. IV, 15, 2, 'They call him
Sa<i>m</i>yadv&acirc;ma, for all blessings (v&acirc;ma) go towards
him (sa<i>m</i>yanti). He is also v&acirc;man&icirc;, for he leads
(nayati) all blessings (v&acirc;ma). He is also
Bh&acirc;man&icirc;, for he shines (bh&acirc;ti) in all worlds').
Therefore, on account of agreement, the person within the eye is
the highest Lord.</p>
<p>14. And on account of the statement of place, and so on.</p>
<p>But how does the confined locality of the eye agree with Brahman
which is omnipresent like the ether?&mdash;To this question we
reply that there would indeed be a want of agreement if that one
locality only were assigned to the Lord. For other localities also,
viz. the earth and so on, are attributed to him in the passage, 'He
who dwells in the earth,' &amp;c. (B<i>ri</i>. Up. III, 7, 3). And
among those the eye also is mentioned, viz. in the clause, 'He who
dwells in the eye,' &amp;c. The phrase 'and so on,' which forms
part of the S&ucirc;tra, intimates that not only locality is
assigned to Brahman, although not (really) appropriate to it, but
that also such things as name and form, although not appropriate to
Brahman which is devoid of name and form, are yet seen to be
attributed to it. That, in such passages as 'His name is ut, he
with the golden beard' (Ch. Up. I, 6, 7, 6), Brahman although
devoid of qualities is spoken of, for the purposes of devotion, as
possessing qualities depending on name and form, we have already
shown. And we have, moreover, shown that to attribute to Brahman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id=
"page126"></a>{126}</span> a definite locality, in spite of his
omnipresence, subserves the purposes of contemplation, and is
therefore not contrary to reason<a id="footnotetag145" name=
"footnotetag145"></a><a href="#footnote145"><sup>145</sup></a>; no
more than to contemplate Vish<i>n</i>u in the sacred
<i>s</i>&acirc;lagr&acirc;m.</p>
<p>15. And on account of the passage referring to that which is
distinguished by pleasure (i.e. Brahman).</p>
<p>There is, moreover, really no room for dispute whether Brahman
be meant in the passage under discussion or not, because the fact
of Brahman being meant is established 'by the reference to that
which is distinguished by pleasure.' For the same Brahman which is
spoken of as characterised by pleasure in the beginning of the
chapter<a id="footnotetag146" name="footnotetag146"></a><a href=
"#footnote146"><sup>146</sup></a>, viz. in the clauses, 'Breath is
Brahman, Ka is Brahman, Kha is Brahman,' that same Brahman we must
suppose to be referred to in the present passage also, it being
proper to adhere to the subject-matter under discussion; the
clause, 'The teacher will tell you the way<a id="footnotetag147"
name="footnotetag147"></a><a href=
"#footnote147"><sup>147</sup></a>,' merely announcing that the way
will be proclaimed [by the teacher; not that a new subject will be
started].&mdash;How then, it may be asked, is it known that
Brahman, as distinguished by pleasure, is spoken of in the
beginning of the passage?&mdash;We reply: On hearing the speech of
the fires, viz. 'Breath is Brahman, Ka is Brahman, Kha is Brahman,'
Upako<i>s</i>ala says, 'I understand that breath is Brahman, but I
do not understand that Ka or Kha is Brahman.' Thereupon the fires
reply, 'What is Ka is Kha, what is Kha is Ka.' Now the word Kha
denotes in ordinary language the elemental ether. If therefore the
word Ka which means pleasure were not applied to qualify the sense
of 'Kha,' we should conclude <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page127" id="page127"></a>{127}</span> that the name Brahman is
here symbolically<a id="footnotetag148" name=
"footnotetag148"></a><a href="#footnote148"><sup>148</sup></a>
given to the mere elemental ether as it is (in other places) given
to mere names and the like. Thus also with regard to the word Ka,
which, in ordinary language, denotes the imperfect pleasure
springing from the contact of the sense-organs with their objects.
If the word Kha were not applied to qualify the sense of Ka we
should conclude that ordinary pleasure is here called Brahman. But
as the two words Ka and Kha (occur together and therefore) qualify
each other, they intimate Brahman whose Self is pleasure. If<a id=
"footnotetag149" name="footnotetag149"></a><a href=
"#footnote149"><sup>149</sup></a> in the passage referred to (viz.
'Breath is Brahman, Ka is Brahman, Kha is Brahman') the second
Brahman (i.e. the word Brahman in the clause 'Ka is Brahman') were
not added, and if the sentence would run 'Ka, Kha is Brahman,' the
word Ka would be employed as a mere qualifying word, and thus
pleasure as being a mere quality would not be represented as a
subject of meditation. To prevent this, both words&mdash;Ka as well
as Kha&mdash;are joined with the word Brahman ('Ka (is) Brahman,
Kha (is) Brahman'). For the passage wishes to intimate that
pleasure also, although a quality, should be meditated upon as
something in which qualities inhere. It thus appears that at the
beginning of the chapter Brahman, as characterised by pleasure, is
spoken of. After that the G&acirc;rhapatya and the other sacred
fires proclaim in turns their own glory, and finally conclude with
the words, 'This is our knowledge, O friend, and the knowledge of
the Self;' wherein they point back to the Brahman spoken of before.
The words, 'The teacher will tell you the way' (which form the last
clause of the concluding passage), merely promise an explanation of
the way, and thus preclude the idea of another topic being started.
The teacher thereupon saying, 'As water does not cling to a lotus
leaf, so no evil deed clings to one who knows it' (which words
intervene between the concluding <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page128" id="page128"></a>{128}</span> speech of the fires and the
information given by the teacher about the person within the eye)
declares that no evil attacks him who knows the person within the
eye, and thereby shows the latter to be Brahman. It thus appears
that the teacher's intention is to speak about that Brahman which
had formed the topic of the instruction of the fires; to represent
it at first as located in the eye and possessing the qualities of
Sa<i>m</i>yadv&acirc;ma and the like, and to point out afterwards
that he who thus knows passes on to light and so on. He therefore
begins by saying, 'That person that is seen in the eye that is the
Self.'</p>
<p>16. And on account of the statement of the way of him who has
heard the Upanishads.</p>
<p>The person placed in the eye is the highest lord for the
following reason also. From <i>s</i>ruti as well as sm<i>ri</i>ti
we are acquainted with the way of him who has heard the Upanishads
or the secret knowledge, i.e. who knows Brahman. That way, called
the path of the gods, is described (Pra. Up. I, 10), 'Those who
have sought the Self by penance, abstinence, faith, and knowledge
gain by the northern path the sun. This is the home of the spirits,
the immortal, free from fear, the highest. From thence they do not
return;' and also (Bha. G&icirc;t&acirc; VIII, 24), 'Fire, light,
the bright fortnight, the six months of the northern progress of
the sun, on that way those who know Brahman go, when they have
died, to Brahman.' Now that very same way is seen to be stated, in
our text, for him who knows the person within the eye. For we read
(Ch. Up. IV, 15, 5), 'Now whether people perform obsequies for him
or no he goes to light;' and later on, 'From the sun (he goes) to
the moon, from the moon to lightning. There is a person not human,
he leads them to Brahman. This is the path of the gods, the path
that leads to Brahman. Those who proceed on that path do not return
to the life of man.' From this description of the way which is
known to be the way of him who knows Brahman we ascertain that the
person within the eye is Brahman.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id=
"page129"></a>{129}</span>
<p>17. (The person within the eye is the highest), not any other
Self; on account of the non-permanency (of the other Selfs) and on
account of the impossibility (of the qualities of the person in the
eye being ascribed to the other Selfs).</p>
<p>To the assertion made in the p&ucirc;rvapaksha that the person
in the eye is either the reflected Self or the cognitional Self
(the individual soul) or the Self of some deity the following
answer is given.&mdash;No other Self such as, for instance, the
reflected Self can be assumed here, on account of
non-permanency.&mdash;The reflected Self, in the first place, does
not permanently abide in the eye. For when some person approaches
the eye the reflection of that person is seen in the eye, but when
the person moves away the reflection is seen no longer. The passage
'That person within the eye' must, moreover, be held, on the ground
of proximity, to intimate that the person seen in a man's own eye
is the object of (that man's) devout meditation (and not the
reflected image of his own person which he may see in the eye of
another man). [Let, then, another man approach the devout man, and
let the latter meditate on the image reflected in his own eye, but
seen by the other man only. No, we reply, for] we have no right to
make the (complicated) assumption that the devout man is, at the
time of devotion, to bring close to his eye another man in order to
produce a reflected image in his own eye. Scripture, moreover,
(viz. Ch. Up. VIII, 9, 1, 'It (the reflected Self) perishes as soon
as the body perishes,') declares the non-permanency of the
reflected Self.&mdash;And, further, 'on account of impossibility'
(the person in the eye cannot be the reflected Self). For
immortality and the other qualities ascribed to the person in the
eye are not to be perceived in the reflected Self.&mdash;Of the
cognitional Self, in the second place, which is in general
connexion with the whole body and all the senses, it can likewise
not be said that it has its permanent station in the eye only.
That, on the other hand, Brahman although all-pervading may, for
the purpose of contemplation, be <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page130" id="page130"></a>{130}</span> spoken of as connected with
particular places such as the heart and the like, we have seen
already. The cognitional Self shares (with the reflected Self) the
impossibility of having the qualities of immortality and so on
attributed to it. Although the cognitional Self is in reality not
different from the highest Self, still there are fictitiously
ascribed to it (adhy&acirc;ropita) the effects of nescience, desire
and works, viz, mortality and fear; so that neither immortality nor
fearlessness belongs to it. The qualities of being the
sa<i>m</i>yadv&acirc;ma, &amp;c. also cannot properly be ascribed
to the cognitional Self, which is not distinguished by lordly power
(ai<i>s</i>varya).&mdash;In the third place, although the Self of a
deity (viz. the sun) has its station in the eye&mdash;according to
the scriptural passage, 'He rests with his rays in him'&mdash;still
Selfhood cannot be ascribed to the sun, on account of his
externality (par&acirc;gr&ucirc;patva). Immortality, &amp;c. also
cannot be predicated of him, as Scripture speaks of his origin and
his dissolution. For the (so-called) deathlessness of the gods only
means their (comparatively) long existence. And their lordly power
also is based on the highest Lord and does not naturally belong to
them; as the mantra declares, 'From terror of it (Brahman) the wind
blows, from terror the sun rises; from terror of it Agni and Indra,
yea, Death runs as the fifth.'&mdash;Hence the person in the eye
must be viewed as the highest Lord only. In the case of this
explanation being adopted the mention (of the person in the eye) as
something well known and established, which is contained in the
words 'is seen' (in the phrase 'the person that is seen in the
eye'), has to be taken as referring to (the mental perception
founded on) the <i>s</i>&acirc;stra which belongs to those who
know; and the glorification (of devout meditation) has to be
understood as its purpose.</p>
<p>18. The internal ruler over the devas and so on (is Brahman),
because the attributes of that (Brahman) are designated.</p>
<p>In B<i>ri</i>. Up. III, 7, 1 ff. we read, 'He who within rules
this world and the other world and all beings,' and later on, 'He
who dwells in the earth and within the earth, whom <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>{131}</span> the earth
does not know, whose body the earth is, who rules the earth within,
he is thy Self, the ruler within, the immortal,' &amp;c. The entire
chapter (to sum up its contents) speaks of a being, called the
antary&acirc;min (the internal ruler), who, dwelling within, rules
with reference to the gods, the world, the Veda, the sacrifice, the
beings, the Self.&mdash;Here now, owing to the unusualness of the
term (antary&acirc;min), there arises a doubt whether it denotes
the Self of some deity which presides over the gods and so on, or
some Yogin who has acquired extraordinary powers, such as, for
instance, the capability of making his body subtle, or the highest
Self, or some other being. What alternative then does recommend
itself?</p>
<p>As the term is an unknown one, the p&ucirc;rvapakshin says, we
must assume that the being denoted by it is also an unknown one,
different from all those mentioned above.&mdash;Or else it may be
said that, on the one hand, we have no right to assume something of
an altogether indefinite character, and that, on the other hand,
the term antary&acirc;min&mdash;which is derived from antaryamana
(ruling within)&mdash;cannot be called altogether unknown, that
therefore antary&acirc;min may be assumed to denote some god
presiding over the earth, and so on. Similarly, we read
(B<i>ri</i>. Up. III, 9, 16), 'He whose dwelling is the earth,
whose sight is fire, whose mind is light,' &amp;c. A god of that
kind is capable of ruling the earth, and so on, dwelling within
them, because he is endowed with the organs of action; rulership is
therefore rightly ascribed to him.&mdash;Or else the rulership
spoken of may belong to some Yogin whom his extraordinary powers
enable to enter within all things.&mdash;The highest Self, on the
other hand, cannot be meant, as it does not possess the organs of
action (which are required for ruling).</p>
<p>To this we make the following reply.&mdash;The internal ruler,
of whom Scripture speaks with reference to the gods, must be the
highest Self, cannot be anything else.&mdash;Why so?&mdash;Because
its qualities are designated in the passage under discussion. The
universal rulership implied in the statement that, dwelling within,
it rules the entire aggregate of created beings, inclusive of the
gods, and so on, is an appropriate <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page132" id="page132"></a>{132}</span> attribute of the highest
Self, since omnipotence depends on (the omnipotent ruler) being the
cause of all created things.&mdash;The qualities of Selfhood and
immortality also, which are mentioned in the passage, 'He is thy
Self, the ruler within, the immortal,' belong in their primary
sense to the highest Self.&mdash;Further, the passage, 'He whom the
earth does not know,' which declares that the internal ruler is not
known by the earth-deity, shows him to be different from that
deity; for the deity of the earth knows itself to be the
earth.&mdash;The attributes 'unseen,' 'unheard,' also point to the
highest Self, which is devoid of shape and other sensible
qualities.&mdash;The objection that the highest Self is destitute
of the organs of action, and hence cannot be a ruler, is without
force, because organs of action may be ascribed to him owing to the
organs of action of those whom he rules.&mdash;If it should be
objected that [if we once admit an internal ruler in addition to
the individual soul] we are driven to assume again another and
another ruler ad infinitum; we reply that this is not the case, as
actually there is no other ruler (but the highest Self<a id=
"footnotetag150" name="footnotetag150"></a><a href=
"#footnote150"><sup>150</sup></a>). The objection would be valid
only in the case of a difference of rulers actually
existing.&mdash;For all these reasons, the internal ruler is no
other but the highest Self.</p>
<p>19. And (the internal ruler is) not that which the Sm<i>ri</i>ti
assumes, (viz. the pradh&acirc;na,) on account of the statement of
qualities not belonging to it.</p>
<p>Good so far, a S&acirc;@nkhya opponent resumes. The attributes,
however, of not being seen, &amp;c., belong also to the
pradh&acirc;na assumed by the S&acirc;@nkhya-sm<i>ri</i>ti, which
is acknowledged to be devoid of form and other sensible qualities.
For their <span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id=
"page133"></a>{133}</span> Sm<i>ri</i>ti says, 'Undiscoverable,
unknowable, as if wholly in sleep' (Manu I, 5). To this
pradh&acirc;na also the attribute of rulership belongs, as it is
the cause of all effects. Therefore the internal ruler may be
understood to denote the pradh&acirc;na. The pradh&acirc;na has,
indeed, been set aside already by the S&ucirc;tra I, 1, 5, but we
bring it forward again, because we find that attributes belonging
to it, such as not being seen and the like, are mentioned in
Scripture.</p>
<p>To this argumentation the S&ucirc;trak&acirc;ra replies that the
word 'internal ruler' cannot denote the pradh&acirc;na, because
qualities not belonging to the latter are stated. For, although the
pradh&acirc;na may be spoken of as not being seen, &amp;c, it
cannot be spoken of as seeing, since the S&acirc;@nkhyas admit it
to be non-intelligent. But the scriptural passage which forms the
complement to the passage about the internal ruler (B<i>ri</i>. Up.
III, 7, 23) says expressly, 'Unseen but seeing, unheard but
hearing, unperceived but perceiving, unknown but
knowing.'&mdash;And Selfhood also cannot belong to the
pradh&acirc;na.</p>
<p>Well, then, if the term 'internal ruler' cannot be admitted to
denote the pradh&acirc;na, because the latter is neither a Self nor
seeing; let us suppose it to denote the embodied (individual) soul,
which is intelligent, and therefore hears, sees, perceives, knows;
which is internal (pratya<i>&ntilde;k</i>), and therefore of the
nature of Self; and which is immortal, because it is able to enjoy
the fruits of its good and evil actions. It is, moreover, a settled
matter that the attributes of not being seen, &amp;c., belong to
the embodied soul, because the agent of an action, such as seeing,
cannot at the same time be the object of the action. This is
declared in scriptural passages also, as, for instance (B<i>ri</i>.
Up. III, 4, 2), 'Thou couldst not see the seer of sight.' The
individual soul is, moreover, capable of inwardly ruling the
complex of the organs of action, as it is the enjoyer. Therefore
the internal ruler is the embodied soul.&mdash;To this reasoning
the following S&ucirc;tra replies.</p>
<p>20. And the embodied soul (also cannot be understood by the
internal ruler), for both also (i.e. both <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>{134}</span>
recensions of the B<i>ri</i>had &Acirc;ra<i>n</i>yaka) speak of it
as different (from the internal ruler).</p>
<p>The word 'not' (in the S&ucirc;tra) has to be supplied from the
preceding S&ucirc;tra. Although the attributes of seeing, &amp;c.,
belong to the individual soul, still as the soul is limited by its
adjuncts, as the ether is by a jar, it is not capable of dwelling
completely within the earth and the other beings mentioned, and to
rule them. Moreover, the followers of both
<i>s</i>&acirc;kh&acirc;s, i.e. the K&acirc;<i>n</i>vas as well as
the M&acirc;dhyandinas, speak in their texts of the individual soul
as different from the internal ruler, viz. as constituting, like
the earth, and so on, his abode and the object of his rule. The
K&acirc;<i>n</i>vas read (B<i>ri</i>. Up. III, 7, 22), 'He who
dwells in knowledge;' the M&acirc;dhyandinas, 'He who dwells in the
Self.' If the latter reading is adopted, the word 'Self' denotes
the individual soul; if the former, the individual soul is denoted
by the word 'knowledge;' for the individual soul consists of
knowledge. It is therefore a settled matter that some being
different from the individual soul, viz. the lord, is denoted by
the term 'internal ruler.'&mdash;But how, it may be asked, is it
possible that there should be within one body two seers, viz. the
lord who rules internally and the individual soul different from
him?&mdash;Why&mdash;we ask in return&mdash;should that be
impossible?&mdash;Because, the opponent replies, it is contrary to
scriptural passages, such as, 'There is no other seer but he,'
&amp;c., which deny that there is any seeing, hearing, perceiving,
knowing Self, but the internal ruler under discussion.&mdash;May,
we rejoin, that passage not have the purpose of denying the
existence of another ruler?&mdash;No, the opponent replies, for
there is no occasion for another ruler (and therefore no occasion
for denying his existence), and the text does not contain any
specification, (but merely denies the existence of any other seer
in general.)</p>
<p>We therefore advance the following final refutation of the
opponent's objection.&mdash;The declaration of the difference of
the embodied Self and the internal ruler has its reason in the
limiting adjunct, consisting of the organs of action, presented by
Nescience, and is not absolutely true. For the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>{135}</span> Self
within is one only; two internal Selfs are not possible. But owing
to its limiting adjunct the one Self is practically treated as if
it were two; just as we make a distinction between the ether of the
jar and the universal ether. Hence there is room for those
scriptural passages which set forth the distinction of knower and
object of knowledge, for perception and the other means of proof,
for the intuitive knowledge of the apparent world, and for that
part of Scripture which contains injunctions and prohibitions. In
accordance with this, the scriptural passage, 'Where there is
duality, as it were, there one sees another,' declares that the
whole practical world exists only in the sphere of Nescience; while
the subsequent passage, 'But when the Self only is all this, how
should he see another?' declares that the practical world vanishes
in the sphere of true knowledge.</p>
<p>21. That which possesses the attributes of invisibility and so
on (is Brahman), on account of the declaration of attributes.</p>
<p>Scripture says, 'The higher knowledge is this by which the
Indestructible is apprehended. That which cannot be seen nor
seized, which is without origin and qualities, without eyes and
ears, without hands and feet, the eternal, all-pervading,
omnipresent, infinitesimal, that which is imperishable, that it is
which the wise regard as the source of all beings' (Mu. Up. I, 1,
5; 6).&mdash;Here the doubt arises whether the source of all beings
which is spoken of as characterised by invisibility, &amp;c. be the
pr&acirc;dhana or the embodied soul, or the highest Lord.</p>
<p>We must, the p&ucirc;rvapakshin says, understand by the source
of all beings the non-intelligent pr&acirc;dhana because (in the
passage immediately subsequent to the one quoted) only
non-intelligent beings are mentioned as parallel instances. 'As the
spider sends forth and draws in its thread, as plants grow on the
earth, as from the living man hairs spring forth on the head and
the body, thus everything arises here from the
Indestructible.'&mdash;But, it <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page136" id="page136"></a>{136}</span> may be objected, men and
spiders which are here quoted as parallel instances are of
intelligent nature.&mdash;No, the p&ucirc;rvapakshin replies; for
the intelligent being as such is not the source of the threads and
the hair, but everybody knows that the non-intelligent body of the
spider ruled by intelligence is the source of the threads; and so
in the case of man also.&mdash;While, moreover, in the case of the
preceding S&ucirc;tra, the pradh&acirc;na hypothesis could not be
accepted, because, although some qualities mentioned, such as
invisibility and so on, agreed with it, others such as being the
seer and the like did not; we have here to do only with attributes
such as invisibility which agree with the pradh&acirc;na, no
attribute of a contrary nature being mentioned.&mdash;But the
qualities mentioned in the complementary passage (Mu. Up. I, 1, 9),
'He who knows all and perceives all,' do not agree with the
non-intelligent pradh&acirc;na; how, then, can the source of all
beings be interpreted to mean the pradh&acirc;na?&mdash;To this the
p&ucirc;rvapakshin replies: The passage, 'The higher knowledge is
that by which the Indestructible is apprehended, that which cannot
be seen,' &amp;c., points, by means of the term 'the
Indestructible,' to the source of all beings characterised by
invisibility and similar attributes. This same 'Indestructible' is
again mentioned later on in the passage, 'It is higher than the
high Imperishable.' Now that which in this latter passage is spoken
of as higher than the Imperishable may possess the qualities of
knowing and perceiving everything, while the pradh&acirc;na denoted
by the term 'the Imperishable' is the source of all
beings.&mdash;If, however, the word 'source' (yoni) be taken in the
sense of operative cause, we may by 'the source of the beings'
understand the embodied Self also, which, by means of merit and
demerit, is the cause of the origin of the complex of things.</p>
<p>To this we make the following reply.&mdash;That which here is
spoken of as the source of all beings, distinguished by such
qualities as invisibility and so on, can be the highest Lord only,
nothing else.&mdash;Whereupon is this conclusion founded?&mdash;On
the statement of attributes. For the clause, 'He who is
all-knowing, all-perceiving,' clearly states an <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>{137}</span> attribute
belonging to the highest Lord only, since the attributes of knowing
all and perceiving all cannot be predicated either of the
non-intelligent pradh&acirc;na or the embodied soul whose power of
sight is narrowed by its limiting conditions. To the objection that
the qualities of knowing and perceiving all are, in the passage
under discussion, attributed to that which is higher than the
source of all beings&mdash;which latter is denoted by the term 'the
Imperishable'&mdash;not to the source itself, we reply that this
explanation is inadmissible because the source of all beings,
which&mdash;in the clause, 'From the Indestructible everything here
arises'&mdash;is designated as the material cause of all created
beings, is later on spoken of as all-knowing, and again as the
cause of all created beings, viz. in the passage (I, 1, 9), 'From
him who knows all and perceives all, whose brooding consists of
knowledge, from him is born that Brahman, name, form, and food.' As
therefore the Indestructible which forms the general topic of
discussion is, owing to the identity of designation, recognised (as
being referred to in the later passage also), we understand that it
is the same Indestructible to which the attributes of knowing and
perceiving all are ascribed.&mdash;We further maintain that also
the passage, 'Higher than the high Imperishable,' does not refer to
any being different from the imperishable source of all beings
which is the general topic of discussion. We conclude this from the
circumstance that the passage, 'He truly told that knowledge of
Brahman through which he knows the imperishable true person,' (I,
2, 13; which passage leads on to the passage about that which is
higher than the Imperishable,) merely declares that the
imperishable source of all beings, distinguished by invisibility
and the like&mdash;which formed the subject of the preceding
chapter&mdash;will be discussed. The reason why that imperishable
source is called higher than the high Imperishable, we shall
explain under the next S&ucirc;tra.&mdash;Moreover, two kinds of
knowledge are enjoined there (in the Upanishad), a lower and a
higher one. Of the lower one it is said that it comprises the
<i>Ri</i>g-veda and so on, and then the text continues, 'The higher
knowledge <span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id=
"page138"></a>{138}</span> is that by which the Indestructible is
apprehended.' Here the Indestructible is declared to be the subject
of the higher knowledge. If we now were to assume that the
Indestructible distinguished by invisibility and like qualities is
something different from the highest Lord, the knowledge referring
to it would not be the higher one. For the distinction of lower and
higher knowledge is made on account of the diversity of their
results, the former leading to mere worldly exaltation, the latter
to absolute bliss; and nobody would assume absolute bliss to result
from the knowledge of the pradh&acirc;na.&mdash;Moreover, as on the
view we are controverting the highest Self would be assumed to be
something higher than the imperishable source of all beings, three
kinds of knowledge would have to be acknowledged, while the text
expressly speaks of two kinds only.&mdash;Further, the reference to
the knowledge of everything being implied in the knowledge of one
thing&mdash;which is contained in the passage (I, 1, 3), 'Sir, what
is that through which if it is known everything else becomes
known?'&mdash;is possible only if the allusion is to Brahman the
Self of all, and not either to the pradh&acirc;na which comprises
only what is non-intelligent or to the enjoyer viewed apart from
the objects of enjoyment.&mdash;The text, moreover, by introducing
the knowledge of Brahman as the chief subject&mdash;which it does
in the passage (I, 1, 1), 'He told the knowledge of Brahman, the
foundation of all knowledge, to his eldest son Atharvan'&mdash;and
by afterwards declaring that out of the two kinds of knowledge,
viz. the lower one and the higher one, the higher one leads to the
comprehension of the Imperishable, shows that the knowledge of the
Imperishable is the knowledge of Brahman. On the other hand, the
term 'knowledge of Brahman' would become meaningless if that
Imperishable which is to be comprehended by means of it were not
Brahman. The lower knowledge of works which comprises the
<i>Ri</i>g-veda, and so on, is mentioned preliminarily to the
knowledge of Brahman for the mere purpose of glorifying the latter;
as appears from the passages in which it (the lower knowledge) is
spoken of slightingly, such as (I, 2, 7), 'But frail <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>{139}</span> indeed
are those boats, the sacrifices, the eighteen in which this lower
ceremonial has been told. Fools who praise this as the highest good
are subject again and again to old age and death.' After these
slighting remarks the text declares that he who turns away from the
lower knowledge is prepared for the highest one (I, 2, 12), 'Let a
Br&aacute;hama<i>n</i>a after he has examined all these worlds
which are gained by works acquire freedom from all desires. Nothing
that is eternal (not made) can be gained by what is not eternal
(made). Let him in order to understand this take fuel in his hand
and approach a guru who is learned and dwells entirely in
Brahman.'&mdash;The remark that, because the earth and other
non-intelligent things are adduced as parallel instances, that also
which is compared to them, viz. the source of all beings must be
non-intelligent, is without foundation, since it is not necessary
that two things of which one is compared to the other should be of
absolutely the same nature. The things, moreover, to which the
source of all beings is compared, viz. the earth and the like, are
material, while nobody would assume the source of all beings to be
material.&mdash;For all these reasons the source of all beings,
which possesses the attributes of invisibility and so on, is the
highest Lord.</p>
<p>22. The two others (i.e. the individual soul and the
pradh&acirc;na) are not (the source of all beings) because there
are stated distinctive attributes and difference.</p>
<p>The source of all beings is the highest Lord, not either of the
two others, viz. the pradh&acirc;na and the individual soul, on
account of the following reason also. In the first place, the text
distinguishes the source of all beings from the embodied soul, as
something of a different nature; compare the passage (II, 1, 2),
'That heavenly person is without body, he is both without and
within, not produced, without breath and without mind, pure.' The
distinctive attributes mentioned here, such as being of a heavenly
nature, and so on, can in no way belong to the individual soul,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id=
"page140"></a>{140}</span> which erroneously considers itself to be
limited by name and form as presented by Nescience, and erroneously
imputes their attributes to itself. Therefore the passage
manifestly refers to the Person which is the subject of all the
Upanishads.&mdash;In the second place, the source of all beings
which forms the general topic is represented in the text as
something different from the pradh&acirc;na, viz. in the passage,
'Higher than the high Imperishable.' Here the term 'Imperishable'
means that undeveloped entity which represents the seminal
potentiality of names and forms, contains the fine parts of the
material elements, abides in the Lord, forms his limiting adjunct,
and being itself no effect is high in comparison to all effects;
the whole phrase, 'Higher than the high Imperishable,' which
expresses a difference then clearly shows that the highest Self is
meant here.&mdash;We do not on that account assume an independent
entity called pradh&acirc;na and say that the source of all beings
is stated separately therefrom; but if a pradh&acirc;na is to be
assumed at all (in agreement with the common opinion) and if being
assumed it is assumed of such a nature as not to be opposed to the
statements of Scripture, viz. as the subtle cause of all beings
denoted by the terms 'the Undeveloped' and so on, we have no
objection to such an assumption, and declare that, on account of
the separate statement therefrom, i.e. from that pradh&acirc;na,
'the source of all beings' must mean the highest Lord.&mdash;A
further argument in favour of the same conclusion is supplied by
the next S&ucirc;tra.</p>
<p>23. And on account of its form being mentioned.</p>
<p>Subsequently to the passage, 'Higher than the high
Imperishable,' we meet (in the passage, 'From him is born breath,'
&amp;c.) with a description of the creation of all things, from
breath down to earth, and then with a statement of the form of this
same source of beings as consisting of all created beings, 'Fire is
his head, his eyes the sun and the moon, the quarters his ears, his
speech the Vedas disclosed, the wind his breath, his heart the
universe; from his feet came the earth; he is indeed the inner Self
of all things.' This statement of form can refer only to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id=
"page141"></a>{141}</span> highest Lord, and not either to the
embodied soul, which, on account of its small power, cannot be the
cause of all effects, or to the pradh&acirc;na, which cannot be the
inner Self of all beings. We therefore conclude that the source of
all beings is the highest Lord, not either of the other
two.&mdash;But wherefrom do you conclude that the quoted
declaration of form refers to the source of all beings?&mdash;From
the general topic, we reply. The word 'he' (in the clause, 'He is
indeed the inner Self of all things') connects the passage with the
general topic. As the source of all beings constitutes the general
topic, the whole passage, from 'From him is born breath,' up to,
'He is the inner Self of all beings,' refers to that same source.
Similarly, when in ordinary conversation a certain teacher forms
the general topic of the talk, the phrase, 'Study under him; he
knows the Veda and the Ved&acirc;@ngas thoroughly,' as a matter of
course, refers to that same teacher.&mdash;But how can a bodily
form be ascribed to the source of all beings which is characterised
by invisibility and similar attributes?&mdash;The statement as to
its nature, we reply, is made for the purpose of showing that the
source of all beings is the Self of all beings, not of showing that
it is of a bodily nature. The case is analogous to such passages
as, 'I am food, I am food, I am the eater of food' (Taitt. Up. III,
10, 6).&mdash;Others, however, are of opinion<a id="footnotetag151"
name="footnotetag151"></a><a href="#footnote151"><sup>151</sup></a>
that the statement quoted does not refer to the source of all
beings, because that to which it refers is spoken of as something
produced. For, on the one hand, the immediately preceding passage
('From him is born health, mind, and all organs of sense, ether,
air, light, water, and the earth, the support of all') speaks of
the aggregate of beings from air down to earth as something
produced, and, on the other <span class="pagenum"><a name="page142"
id="page142"></a>{142}</span> hand, a passage met with later on
('From him comes Agni, the sun being his fuel,' up to 'All herbs
and juices') expresses itself to the same purpose. How then should
all at once, in the midst of these two passages (which refer to the
creation), a statement be made about the nature of the source of
all beings?&mdash;The attribute of being the Self of all beings,
(which above was said to be mentioned in the passage about the
creation, 'Fire is his head,' &amp;c., is not mentioned there but)
is stated only later on in a passage subsequent to that which
refers to the creation, viz. 'The Person is all this, sacrifice,'
&amp;c. (II, 1, 10).&mdash;Now, we see that <i>s</i>ruti as well as
sm<i>ri</i>ti speaks of the birth of Praj&acirc;pati, whose body is
this threefold world; compare <i>Ri</i>g-veda Sa<i>m</i>h. X, 121,
1, 'Hira<i>n</i>ya-garbha arose in the beginning; he was the one
born Lord of things existing. He established the earth and this
sky; to what God shall we offer our oblation?' where the expression
'arose' means 'he was born.' And in sm<i>ri</i>ti we read, 'He is
the first embodied one, he is called the Person; as the primal
creator of the beings Brahman was evolved in the beginning.' This
Person which is (not the original Brahman but) an effect (like
other created beings) may be called the internal Self of all beings
(as it is called in II, 1, 4), because in the form of the Self of
breath it abides in the Selfs of all beings.&mdash;On this latter
explanation (according to which the passage, 'Fire is his head,'
&amp;c., does not describe the nature of the highest Lord, and can
therefore not be referred to in the S&ucirc;tra) the declaration as
to the Lord being the 'nature' of all which is contained in the
passage, 'The Person is all this, sacrifice,' &amp;c., must be
taken as the reason for establishing the highest Lord, (i.e. as the
passage which, according to the S&ucirc;tra, proves that the source
of all beings is the highest Lord<a id="footnotetag152" name=
"footnotetag152"></a><a href=

<p>24. Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara (is the highest Lord) on account of
the distinction qualifying the common terms
(Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara and Self).</p>
<p>(In Ch. Up. V, 11 ff.) a discussion begins with the words, 'What
is our Self, what is Brahman?' and is carried on in the passage,
'You know at present that Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara Self, tell us
that;' after that it is declared with reference to Heaven, sun,
air, ether, water, and earth, that they are connected with the
qualities of having good light, &amp;c., and, in order to disparage
devout meditation on them singly, that they stand to the
Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara in the relation of being his head, &amp;c.,
merely; and then finally (V, 18) it is said, 'But he who meditates
on the Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara Self as measured by a span, as
abhivim&acirc;na<a id="footnotetag153" name=
"footnotetag153"></a><a href="#footnote153"><sup>153</sup></a>, he
eats food in all worlds, in all beings, in all Selfs. Of that
Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara Self the head is Sutejas (having good
light), the eye Vi<i>s</i>var&ucirc;pa (multiform), the breath
P<i>ri</i>thagvartman (moving in various courses), the trunk Bahula
(full), the bladder Rayi (wealth), the feet the earth, the chest
the altar, the hairs the grass on the altar, the heart the
G&acirc;rhapatya fire, the mind the Anv&acirc;h&acirc;rya fire, the
mouth the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya fire.'&mdash;Here the doubt arises
whether by the term 'Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara' we have to understand
the gastric fire, or the elemental fire, or the divinity presiding
over the latter, or the embodied soul, or the highest
Lord.&mdash;But what, it may be asked, gives rise to this
doubt?&mdash;The circumstance, we reply, of
'Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara' being employed as a common term for the
gastric fire, the elemental fire, and the divinity of the latter,
while 'Self' is a term applying to the embodied soul as well as to
the highest Lord. Hence the doubt arises which meaning of the term
is to be accepted and which to be set aside.</p>
<p>Which, then, is the alternative to be
embraced?&mdash;Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara, the p&ucirc;rvapakshin
maintains, is the gastric fire, because we meet, in some passages,
with the term used in <span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id=
"page144"></a>{144}</span> that special sense; so, for instance
(B<i>ri</i>. Up. V, 9), 'Agni Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara is the fire
within man by which the food that is eaten is cooked.'&mdash;Or
else the term may denote fire in general, as we see it used in that
sense also; so, for instance (<i>Ri</i>g-veda Sa<i>m</i>h. X, 88,
12), 'For the whole world the gods have made the Agni
Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara a sign of the days.' Or, in the third
place, the word may denote that divinity whose body is fire. For
passages in which the term has that sense are likewise met with;
compare, for instance, <i>Ri</i>g-veda Sa<i>m</i>h. I, 98, 1, 'May
we be in the favour of Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara; for he is the king
of the beings, giving pleasure, of ready grace;' this and similar
passages properly applying to a divinity endowed with power and
similar qualities. Perhaps it will be urged against the preceding
explanations, that, as the word Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara is used in
co-ordination with the term 'Self,' and as the term 'Self' alone is
used in the introductory passage ('What is our Self, what is
Brahman?'), Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara has to be understood in a
modified sense, so as to be in harmony with the term Self. Well,
then, the p&ucirc;rvapakshin rejoins, let us suppose that
Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara is the embodied Self which, as being an
enjoyer, is in close vicinity to the Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara
fire,<a id="footnotetag154" name="footnotetag154"></a><a href=
"#footnote154"><sup>154</sup></a> (i.e. the fire within the body,)
and with which the qualification expressed by the term, 'Measured
by a span,' well agrees, since it is restricted by its limiting
condition (viz. the body and so on).&mdash;In any case it is
evident that the term Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara does not denote the
highest Lord.</p>
<p>To this we make the following reply.&mdash;The word
Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara denotes the highest Self, on account of the
distinction qualifying the two general terms.&mdash;Although the
term 'Self,' as well as the term 'Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara,' has
various meanings&mdash;the latter term denoting three beings while
the former denotes two&mdash;yet we observe a distinction from
which we conclude that both terms can here denote the highest Lord
only; viz. in the passage, 'Of that Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara Self
the head is Sutejas,' &amp;c. For it is clear that that passage
refers to the highest Lord in so far as he is distinguished by
having heaven, and so on, for his head and limbs, and in so far as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id=
"page145"></a>{145}</span> he has entered into a different state
(viz. into the state of being the Self of the threefold world);
represents him, in fact, for the purpose of meditation, as the
internal Self of everything. As such the absolute Self may be
represented, because it is the cause of everything; for as the
cause virtually contains all the states belonging to its effects,
the heavenly world, and so on, may be spoken of as the members of
the highest Self.&mdash;Moreover, the result which Scripture
declares to abide in all worlds&mdash;viz. in the passage, 'He eats
food in all worlds, in all beings, in all Selfs'&mdash;is possible
only if we take the term Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara to denote the
highest Self.&mdash;The same remark applies to the declaration that
all the sins are burned of him who has that knowledge, 'Thus all
his sins are burned,' &amp;c. (Ch. Up. V, 24, 3).&mdash;Moreover,
we meet at the beginning of the chapter with the words 'Self' and
'Brahman;' viz. in the passage, 'What is our Self, what is
Brahman?' Now these are marks of Brahman, and indicate the highest
Lord only. Hence he only can be meant by the term
Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara.</p>
<p>25. (And) because that which is stated by Sm<i>ri</i>ti (i.e.
the shape of the highest Lord as described by Sm<i>ri</i>ti) is an
inference (i.e. an indicatory mark from which we infer the meaning
of <i>S</i>ruti).</p>
<p>The highest Lord only is Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara, for that
reason also that Sm<i>ri</i>ti ascribes to the highest Lord only a
shape consisting of the threefold world, the fire constituting his
mouth, the heavenly world his head, &amp;c. So, for instance, in
the following passage, 'He whose mouth is fire, whose head the
heavenly world, whose navel the ether, whose feet the earth, whose
eye the sun, whose ears the regions, reverence to him the Self of
the world.' The shape described here in Sm<i>ri</i>ti allows us to
infer a <i>S</i>ruti passage on which the Sm<i>ri</i>ti rests, and
thus constitutes an inference, i.e. a sign indicatory of the word
'Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara' denoting the highest Lord. For, although
the quoted Sm<i>ri</i>ti passage contains a glorification<a id=
"footnotetag155" name="footnotetag155"></a><a href=
"#footnote155"><sup>155</sup></a>, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page146" id="page146"></a>{146}</span> still even a glorification
in the form in which it there appears is not possible, unless it
has a Vedic passage to rest on.&mdash;Other Sm<i>ri</i>ti passages
also may be quoted in connexion with this S&ucirc;tra, so, for
instance, the following one, 'He whose head the wise declare to be
the heavenly world, whose navel the ether, whose eyes sun and moon,
whose ears the regions, and whose feet the earth, he is the
inscrutable leader of all beings.'</p>
<p>26. If it be maintained that (Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara is) not
(the highest Lord) on account of the term (viz.
Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara, having a settled different meaning),
&amp;c., and on account of his abiding within (which is a
characteristic of the gastric fire); (we say) no, on account of the
perception (of the highest Lord), being taught thus (viz. in the
gastric fire), and on account of the impossibility (of the heavenly
world, &amp;c. being the head, &amp;c. of the gastric fire), and
because they (the V&acirc;jasaneyins) read of him (viz. the
Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara) as man (which term cannot apply to the
gastric fire).</p>
<p>Here the following objection is
raised.&mdash;Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara cannot be the highest Lord,
on account of the term, &amp;c., and on account of the abiding
within. The term, viz. the term Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara, cannot be
applied to the highest Lord, because the settled use of language
assigns to it a different sense. Thus, also, with regard to the
term Agni (fire) in the passage (<i>S</i>at. Br&acirc;. X, 6, 1,
11), 'He is the Agni Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara.' The word '&amp;c.'
(in the S&ucirc;tra) hints at the fiction concerning the three
sacred fires, the g&acirc;rhapatya being represented as the heart,
and so on, of the Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara Self (Ch. Up. V, 18,
2<a id="footnotetag156" name="footnotetag156"></a><a href=
"#footnote156"><sup>156</sup></a>).&mdash;Moreover, the passage,
'Therefore the first food which a man may take is in the place of
homa' (Ch. Up. V, 19, 1), contains a glorification of
(Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara) being the abode of the oblation to
pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a<a id="footnotetag157" name=
"footnotetag157"></a><a href="#footnote157"><sup>157</sup></a>. For
these reasons we have to understand <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page147" id="page147"></a>{147}</span> by Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara
the gastric fire.&mdash;Moreover, Scripture speaks of the
Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara as abiding within. 'He knows him abiding
within man;' which again applies to the gastric fire
only.&mdash;With reference to the averment that on account of the
specifications contained in the passage, 'His head is Sutejas,'
&amp;c., Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara is to be explained as the highest
Self, we (the p&ucirc;rvapakshin) ask: How do you reach the
decision that those specifications, although agreeing with both
interpretations, must be assumed to refer to the highest Lord only,
and not to the gastric fire?&mdash;Or else we may assume that the
passage speaks of the elemental fire which abides within and
without; for that that fire is also connected with the heavenly
world, and so on, we understand from the mantra, 'He who with his
light has extended himself over earth and heaven, the two halves of
the world, and the atmosphere' (<i>Ri</i>g-veda Sa<i>m</i>h. X, 88,
3).&mdash;Or else the attribute of having the heavenly world, and
so on, for its members may, on account of its power, be attributed
to that divinity which has the elemental fire for its
body.&mdash;Therefore Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara is not the highest
Lord.</p>
<p>To all this we reply as follows.&mdash;Your assertions are
unfounded, 'because there is taught the perception in this manner.'
The reasons (adduced in the former part of the S&ucirc;tra), viz.
the term, and so on, are not sufficient to make us abandon the
interpretation according to which Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara is the
highest Lord.&mdash;Why?&mdash;On account of perception being
taught in this manner, i.e. without the gastric fire being set
aside. For the passages quoted teach the perception of the highest
Lord in the gastric fire, analogously to such passages as 'Let a
man meditate on the mind as Brahman' (Ch. Up. III, 18, 1).&mdash;Or
else they teach that the object of perception is the highest Lord,
in so far as he has the gastric fire called Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara
for his limiting condition; analogously to such passages as 'He who
consists of mind, whose body is breath, whose form is light' (Ch.
Up. III, 14, 2<a id="footnotetag158" name=
"footnotetag158"></a><a href="#footnote158"><sup>158</sup></a>). If
it were the aim of the passages about the Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id=
"page148"></a>{148}</span> to make statements not concerning the
highest Lord, but merely concerning the gastric fire, there would
be no possibility of specifications such as contained in the
passage 'His head is Sutejas,' &amp;c. That also on the assumption
of Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara being either the divinity of fire or the
elemental fire no room is to be found for the said specifications,
we shall show under the following S&ucirc;tra.&mdash;Moreover, if
the mere gastric fire were meant, there would be room only for a
declaration that it abides within man, not that it is man. But, as
a matter of fact, the V&acirc;jasaneyins speak of him&mdash;in
their sacred text&mdash;as man, 'This Agni Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara
is man; he who knows this Agni Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara as man-like,
as abiding within man,' &amp;c. (<i>S</i>at. Br&acirc;. X, 6, 1,
11). The highest Lord, on the other hand, who is the Self of
everything, may be spoken of as well as man, as abiding within
man.&mdash;Those who, in the latter part of the S&ucirc;tra, read
'man-like' (puru-shavidham) instead of 'man' (purusham), wish to
express the following meaning: If Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara were
assumed to be the gastric fire only, he might be spoken of as
abiding within man indeed, but not as man-like. But the
V&acirc;jasaneyins do speak of him as man-like, 'He who knows him
as man-like, as abiding within man.'&mdash;The meaning of the term
man-like is to be concluded from the context, whence it will be
seen that, with reference to nature, it means that the highest Lord
has the heaven for his head, &amp;c., and is based on the earth;
and with reference to man, that he forms the head, &amp;c., and is
based on the chin (of the devout worshipper<a id="footnotetag159"
name="footnotetag159"></a><a href=
"#footnote159"><sup>159</sup></a>).</p>
<p>27. For the same reasons (the Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara) cannot be
the divinity (of fire), or the element (of fire).</p>
<p>The averment that the fanciful attribution of members contained
in the passage 'His head is Sutejas,' &amp;c. may apply to the
elemental fire also which from the mantras is seen to be connected
with the heavenly world, &amp;c., or else to the divinity whose
body is fire, on account of its power, is refuted by the following
remark: For the reasons <span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id=
"page149"></a>{149}</span> already stated Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara
is neither the divinity nor the element. For to the elemental fire
which is mere heat and light the heavenly world and so on cannot
properly be ascribed as head and so on, because an effect cannot be
the Self of another effect.&mdash;Again, the heavenly world cannot
be ascribed as head, &amp;c. to the divinity of fire, in spite of
the power of the latter; for, on the one hand, it is not a cause
(but a mere effect), and on the other hand its power depends on the
highest Lord. Against all these interpretations there lies moreover
the objection founded on the inapplicability of the term
'Self.'</p>
<p>28. Jaimini (declares that there is) no contradiction even on
the assumption of a direct (worship of the highest Lord as
Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara).</p>
<p>Above (S&ucirc;tra 26) it has been said that
Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara is the highest Lord, to be meditated upon
as having the gastric fire either for his outward manifestation or
for his limiting condition; which interpretation was accepted in
deference to the circumstance that he is spoken of as abiding
within&mdash;and so on.&mdash;The teacher Jaimini however is of
opinion that it is not necessary to have recourse to the assumption
of an outward manifestation or limiting condition, and that there
is no objection to refer the passage about Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara
to the direct worship of the highest Lord.&mdash;But, if you reject
the interpretation based on the gastric fire, you place yourself in
opposition to the statement that Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara abides
within, and to the reasons founded on the term, &amp;c. (S&ucirc;.
26).&mdash;To this we reply that we in no way place ourselves in
opposition to the statement that Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara abides
within. For the passage, 'He knows him as man-like, as abiding
within man,' does not by any means refer to the gastric fire, the
latter being neither the general topic of discussion nor having
been mentioned by name before.&mdash;What then does it refer
to?&mdash;It refers to that which forms the subject of discussion,
viz. that similarity to man (of the highest Self) which is
fancifully found in the members of man from the upper part of the
head down to the chin; the text therefore says, 'He knows him as
man-like, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id=
"page150"></a>{150}</span> as abiding within man,' just as we say
of a branch that it abides within the tree<a id="footnotetag160"
name="footnotetag160"></a><a href=
"#footnote160"><sup>160</sup></a>.&mdash;Or else we may adopt
another interpretation and say that after the highest Self has been
represented as having the likeness to man as a limiting condition,
with regard to nature as well as to man, the passage last quoted
('He knows him as abiding within man') speaks of the same highest
Self as the mere witness (s&acirc;kshin; i.e. as the pure Self,
non-related to the limiting conditions).&mdash;The consideration of
the context having thus shown that the highest Self has to be
resorted to for the interpretation of the passage, the term
'Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara' must denote the highest Self in some way
or other. The word 'Vi<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara' is to be explained
either as 'he who is all and man (i.e. the individual soul),' or
'he to whom souls belong' (in so far as he is their maker or
ruler), and thus denotes the highest Self which is the Self of all.
And the form 'Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara' has the same meaning as
'Vi<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara,' the taddhita-suffix, by which the former
word is derived from the latter, not changing the meaning; just as
in the case of r&acirc;kshasa (derived from rakshas), and
v&acirc;yasa (derived from vayas).&mdash;The word 'Agni' also may
denote the highest Self if we adopt the etymology
agni=agra<i>n</i>&icirc;, i.e. he who leads in front.&mdash;As the
G&acirc;rhapatya-fire finally, and as the abode of the oblation to
breath the highest Self may be represented because it is the Self
of all.</p>
<p>But, if it is assumed that Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara denotes the
highest Self, how can Scripture declare that he is measured by a
span?&mdash;On the explanation of this difficulty we now enter.</p>
<p>29. On account of the manifestation, so &Acirc;<i>s</i>marathya
opines.</p>
<p>The circumstance of the highest Lord who transcends all measure
being spoken of as measured by a span has for its reason
'manifestation.' The highest Lord manifests <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>{151}</span> himself
as measured by a span, i.e. he specially manifests himself for the
benefit of his worshippers in some special places, such as the
heart and the like, where he may be perceived. Hence, according to
the opinion of the teacher &Acirc;<i>s</i>marathya, the scriptural
passage which speaks of him who is measured by a span may refer to
the highest Lord.</p>
<p>30. On account of remembrance; so B&acirc;dari opines.</p>
<p>Or else the highest Lord may be called 'measured by a span'
because he is remembered by means of the mind which is seated in
the heart which is measured by a span. Similarly, barley-corns
which are measured by means of prasthas are themselves called
prasthas. It must be admitted that barley-grains themselves have a
certain size which is merely rendered manifest through their being
connected with a prastha measure; while the highest Lord himself
does not possess a size to be rendered manifest by his connexion
with the heart. Still the remembrance (of the Lord by means of the
mind) may be accepted as offering a certain foundation for the
<i>S</i>ruti passage concerning him who is measured by a
span.&mdash;Or else<a id="footnotetag161" name=
"footnotetag161"></a><a href="#footnote161"><sup>161</sup></a> the
S&ucirc;tra may be interpreted to mean that the Lord, although not
really measured by a span, is to be remembered (meditated upon) as
being of the measure of a span; whereby the passage is furnished
with an appropriate sense.&mdash;Thus the passage about him who is
measured by a span may, according to the opinion of the teacher
B&acirc;dari, be referred to the highest Lord, on account of
remembrance.</p>
<p>31. On the ground of imaginative identification (the highest
Lord may be called pr&acirc;de<i>s</i>am&acirc;tra), Jaimini
thinks; for thus (Scripture) declares.</p>
<p>Or else the passage about him who is measured by a span may be
considered to rest on imaginative
combination.&mdash;Why?&mdash;Because the passage of the
V&acirc;jasaneyibr&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>{152}</span> which
treats of the same topic identifies heaven, earth, and so
on&mdash;which are the members of Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara viewed as
the Self of the threefold world&mdash;with certain parts of the
human frame, viz. the parts comprised between the upper part of the
head and the chin, and thus declares the imaginative identity of
Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara with something whose measure is a span.
There we read, 'The Gods indeed reached him, knowing him as
measured by a span as it were. Now I will declare them (his
members) to you so as to identify him (the Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara)
with that whose measure is a span; thus he said. Pointing to the
upper part of the head he said: This is what stands above (i.e. the
heavenly world) as Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara (i.e. the head of
Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara<a id="footnotetag162" name=
"footnotetag162"></a><a href="#footnote162"><sup>162</sup></a>).
Pointing to the eyes he said: This is he with good light (i.e. the
sun) as Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara (i.e. the eye of V.). Pointing to
the nose he said: This is he who moves on manifold paths (i.e. the
air) as Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara (i.e. the breath of V.). Pointing
to the space (ether) within his mouth he said: This is the full one
(i.e. the ether) as Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara. Pointing to the saliva
within his mouth he said: This is wealth as Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara
(i.e. the water in the bladder of V.). Pointing to the chin he
said: This is the base as Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara (i.e. the feet of
V.).'&mdash;Although in the V&acirc;jasaneyi-br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a
the heaven is denoted as that which has the attribute of standing
above and the sun as that which has the attribute of good light,
while in the Ch&acirc;ndogya the heaven is spoken of as having good
light and the sun as being multiform; still this difference does
not interfere (with the unity of the vidy&acirc;)<a id=
"footnotetag163" name="footnotetag163"></a><a href=
"#footnote163"><sup>163</sup></a>, because both texts equally use
the term 'measured by a span,' and because all
<i>s</i>&acirc;kh&acirc;s intimate the same.&mdash;The above
explanation of the term 'measured by a span,' which rests on
imaginative identification, the teacher Jaimini considers the most
appropriate one.</p>
<p>32. Moreover they (the J&acirc;b&acirc;las) speak of him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id=
"page153"></a>{153}</span> (the highest Lord) in that (i.e. the
interstice between the top of the head and the chin which is
measured by a span).</p>
<p>Moreover the J&acirc;b&acirc;las speak in their text of the
highest Lord as being in the interstice between the top of the head
and the chin. 'The unevolved infinite Self abides in the avimukta
(i.e. the non-released soul). Where does that avimukta abide? It
abides in the Vara<i>n</i>&acirc; and the N&acirc;s&icirc;, in the
middle. What is that Vara<i>n</i>&acirc;, what is that
N&acirc;s&icirc;?' The text thereupon etymologises the term
Vara<i>n</i>&acirc; as that which wards off (v&acirc;rayati) all
evil done by the senses, and the term N&acirc;s&icirc; as that
which destroys (n&acirc;<i>s</i>ayati) all evil done by the senses;
and then continues, 'And what is its place?&mdash;The place where
the eyebrows and the nose join. That is the joining place of the
heavenly world (represented by the upper part of the head) and of
the other (i.e. the earthly world represented by the chin).'
(J&acirc;b&acirc;la Up. I.)&mdash;Thus it appears that the
scriptural statement which ascribes to the highest Lord the measure
of a span is appropriate. That the highest Lord is called
abhivim&acirc;na refers to his being the inward Self of all. As
such he is directly measured, i.e. known by all animate beings. Or
else the word may be explained as 'he who is near
everywhere&mdash;as the inward Self&mdash;and who at the same time
is measureless' (as being infinite). Or else it may denote the
highest Lord as him who, as the cause of the world, measures it
out, i.e. creates it. By all this it is proved that
Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara is the highest Lord.</p>

<h4>THIRD P&Acirc;DA.</h4>
<center>REVERENCE TO THE HIGHEST SELF!</center>
<p>1. The abode of heaven, earth, and so on (is Brahman), on
account of the term 'own,' i.e. Self.</p>
<p>We read (Mu. Up. II, 2, 5), 'He in whom the heaven, the earth,
and the sky are woven, the mind also with all the vital airs, know
him alone as the Self, and leave off other words! He is the bridge
of the Immortal.'&mdash;Here the doubt arises whether the abode
which is intimated by the statement of the heaven and so on being
woven in it is the highest Brahman or something else.</p>
<p>The p&ucirc;rvapakshin maintains that the abode is something
else, on account of the expression, 'It is the bridge of the
Immortal.' For, he says, it is known from every-day experience that
a bridge presupposes some further bank to which it leads, while it
is impossible to assume something further beyond the highest
Brahman, which in Scripture is called 'endless, without a further
shore' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. II, 4, 12). Now if the abode is supposed to
be something different from Brahman, it must be supposed to be
either the pradh&acirc;na known from Sm<i>ri</i>ti, which, as being
the (general) cause, may be called the (general) abode; or the air
known from <i>S</i>ruti, of which it is said (B<i>ri</i>. Up. III,
7, 2, 'Air is that thread, O Gautama. By air as by a thread, O
Gautama, this world and the other world and all beings are strung
together'), that it supports all things; or else the embodied soul
which, as being the enjoyer, may be considered as an abode with
reference to the objects of its fruition.</p>
<p>Against this view we argue with the s&ucirc;trak&acirc;ra as
follows:&mdash;'Of the world consisting of heaven, earth, and so
on, which in the quoted passage is spoken of as woven (upon
something), the highest Brahman must be the
abode.'&mdash;Why?&mdash;On account of the word 'own,' i.e. on
account of the word 'Self.' For we meet with the word 'Self' in the
passage, 'Know him alone as the Self.' This term 'Self' is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id=
"page155"></a>{155}</span> thoroughly appropriate only if we
understand the highest Self and not anything else.&mdash;(To
propound another interpretation of the phrase
'sva<i>s</i>abd&acirc;t' employed in the S&ucirc;tra.) Sometimes
also Brahman is spoken of in <i>S</i>ruti as the general abode by
its own terms (i.e. by terms properly designating Brahman), as, for
instance (Ch. Up. VI. 8, 4), 'All these creatures, my dear, have
their root in the being, their abode in the being, their rest in
the being<a id="footnotetag164" name="footnotetag164"></a><a href=
"#footnote164"><sup>164</sup></a>.'&mdash;(Or else we have to
explain 'sva<i>s</i>abdena' as follows), In the passages preceding
and following the passage under discussion Brahman is glorified
with its own names<a id="footnotetag165" name=
"footnotetag165"></a><a href="#footnote165"><sup>165</sup></a>; cp.
Mu. Up. II, 1, 10, 'The Person is all this, sacrifice, penance,
Brahman, the highest Immortal,' and II, 2, 11, 'That immortal
Brahman is before, is behind, Brahman is to the right and left.'
Here, on account of mention being made of an abode and that which
abides, and on account of the co-ordination expressed in the
passage, 'Brahman is all' (Mu. Up. II, 2, 11), a suspicion might
arise that Brahman is of a manifold variegated nature, just as in
the case of a tree consisting of different parts we distinguish
branches, stem, and root. In order to remove this suspicion the
text declares (in the passage under discussion), 'Know him alone as
the Self.' The sense of which is: The Self is not to be known as
manifold, qualified by the universe of effects; you are rather to
dissolve by true knowledge the universe of effects, which is the
mere product of Nescience, and to know that one Self, which is the
general abode, as uniform. Just as when somebody says, 'Bring that
on which Devadatta sits,' the person addressed brings the chair
only (the abode of Devadatta), not Devadatta himself; so the
passage, 'Know him alone as the Self,' teaches that the object to
be known is the one uniform Self which constitutes the general
abode. Similarly another scriptural passage reproves him who
believes in the unreal world of effects, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>{156}</span> 'From
death to death goes he who sees any difference here' (Ka. Up. II,
4, 11). The statement of co-ordination made in the clause 'All is
Brahman' aims at dissolving (the wrong conception of the reality
of) the world, and not in any way at intimating that Brahman is
multiform in nature<a id="footnotetag166" name=
"footnotetag166"></a><a href="#footnote166"><sup>166</sup></a>; for
the uniformity (of Brahman's nature) is expressly stated in other
passages such as the following one, 'As a mass of salt has neither
inside nor outside, but is altogether a mass of taste, thus indeed
has that Self neither inside nor outside, but is altogether a mass
of knowledge' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. IV, 5, 13).&mdash;For all these
reasons the abode of heaven, earth, &amp;c. is the highest
Brahman.&mdash;Against the objection that on account of the text
speaking of a 'bridge,' and a bridge requiring a further bank, we
have to understand by the abode of heaven and earth something
different from Brahman, we remark that the word 'bridge' is meant
to intimate only that that which is called a bridge supports, not
that it has a further bank. We need not assume by any means that
the bridge meant is like an ordinary bridge made of clay and wood.
For as the word setu (bridge) is derived from the root si, which
means 'to bind,' the idea of holding together, supporting is rather
implied in it than the idea of being connected with something
beyond (a further bank).</p>
<p>According to the opinion of another (commentator) the word
'bridge' does not glorify the abode of heaven, earth, &amp;c., but
rather the knowledge of the Self which is glorified in the
preceding clause, 'Know him alone as the Self,' and the abandonment
of speech advised in the clause, 'leave off other words;' to them,
as being the means of obtaining immortality, the expression 'the
bridge of the immortal' applies<a id="footnotetag167" name=
"footnotetag167"></a><a href="#footnote167"><sup>167</sup></a>. On
that account we have to set aside the assertion that, on account of
the word 'bridge,' something different from Brahman is to be
understood by the abode of heaven, earth, and so on.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id=
"page157"></a>{157}</span>
<p>2. And on account of its being designated as that to which the
Released have to resort.</p>
<p>By the abode of heaven, earth, and so on, we have to understand
the highest Brahman for that reason also that we find it denoted as
that to which the Released have to resort.&mdash;The conception
that the body and other things contained in the sphere of the
Not-self are our Self, constitutes Nescience; from it there spring
desires with regard to whatever promotes the well-being of the body
and so on, and aversions with regard to whatever tends to injure
it; there further arise fear and confusion when we observe anything
threatening to destroy it. All this constitutes an endless series
of the most manifold evils with which we all are acquainted.
Regarding those on the other hand who have freed themselves from
the stains of Nescience desire aversion and so on, it is said that
they have to resort to that, viz. the abode of heaven, earth,
&amp;c. which forms the topic of discussion. For the text, after
having said, 'The fetter of the heart is broken, all doubts are
solved, all his works perish when He has been beheld who is the
higher and the lower' (Mu. Up. II, 2, 8), later on remarks, 'The
wise man freed from name and form goes to the divine Person who is
greater than the great' (Mu. Up. III, 2, 8). That Brahman is that
which is to be resorted to by the released, is known from other
scriptural passages, such as 'When all desires which once entered
his heart are undone then does the mortal become immortal, then he
obtains Brahman' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. IV, 4, 7). Of the pradh&acirc;na
and similar entities, on the other hand, it is not known from any
source that they are to be resorted to by the released. Moreover,
the text (in the passage, 'Know him alone as the Self and leave off
other words') declares that the knowledge of the abode of heaven
and earth, &amp;c. is connected with the leaving off of all speech;
a condition which, according to another scriptural passage,
attaches to (the knowledge of) Brahman; cp. B<i>ri</i>. Up. IV, 4,
21, 'Let a wise br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a, after he has discovered him,
practise wisdom. Let him not seek after many words, for that is
mere weariness of the tongue.'&mdash;For that <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>{158}</span> reason
also the abode of heaven, earth, and so on, is the highest
Brahman.</p>
<p>3. Not (i.e. the abode of heaven, earth, &amp;c. cannot be) that
which is inferred, (i.e. the pradh&acirc;na), on account of the
terms not denoting it.</p>
<p>While there has been shown a special reason in favour of Brahman
(being the abode), there is no such special reason in favour of
anything else. Hence he (the s&ucirc;trak&acirc;ra) says that that
which is inferred, i.e. the pradh&acirc;na assumed by the
S&acirc;@nkhya-sm<i>ri</i>ti, is not to be accepted as the abode of
heaven, earth, &amp;c.&mdash;Why?&mdash;On account of the terms not
denoting it. For the sacred text does not contain any term
intimating the non-intelligent pradh&acirc;na, on the ground of
which we might understand the latter to be the general cause or
abode; while such terms as 'he who perceives all and knows all'
(Mu. Up. I, 1, 9) intimate an intelligent being opposed to the
pradh&acirc;na in nature.&mdash;For the same reason the air also
cannot be accepted as the abode of heaven, earth, and so on.</p>
<p>4. (Nor) also the individual soul
(pr&acirc;<i>n</i>abh<i>ri</i>t).</p>
<p>Although to the cognitional (individual) Self the qualities of
Selfhood and intelligence do belong, still omniscience and similar
qualities do not belong to it as its knowledge is limited by its
adjuncts; thus the individual soul also cannot be accepted as the
abode of heaven, earth, &amp;c., for the same reason, i.e. on
account of the terms not denoting it.&mdash;Moreover, the attribute
of forming the abode of heaven, earth, and so on, cannot properly
be given to the individual soul because the latter is limited by
certain adjuncts and therefore non-pervading (not
omnipresent)<a id="footnotetag168" name=
"footnotetag168"></a><a href=
"#footnote168"><sup>168</sup></a>.&mdash;The special enunciation
(of the individual soul) is caused by what follows<a id=
"footnotetag169" name="footnotetag169"></a><a href=
"#footnote169"><sup>169</sup></a>.&mdash;The individual soul is not
to be <span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id=
"page159"></a>{159}</span> accepted as the abode of heaven, earth,
&amp;c. for the following reason also.</p>
<p>5. On account of the declaration of difference.</p>
<p>The passage 'Know him alone as the Self' moreover implies a
declaration of difference, viz. of the difference of the object of
knowledge and the knower. Here the individual soul as being that
which is desirous of release is the knower, and consequently
Brahman, which is denoted by the word 'self' and represented as the
object of knowledge, is understood to be the abode of heaven,
earth, and so on.&mdash;For the following reason also the
individual soul cannot be accepted as the abode of heaven, earth,
&amp;c.</p>
<p>6. On account of the subject-matter.</p>
<p>The highest Self constitutes the subject-matter (of the entire
chapter), as we see from the passage, 'Sir, what is that through
which, when it is known, everything else becomes known?' (Mu. Up.
I, 1, 3) in which the knowledge of everything is declared to be
dependent on the knowledge of one thing. For all this (i.e. the
entire world) becomes known if Brahman the Self of all is known,
not if only the individual soul is known.&mdash;Another reason
against the individual soul follows.</p>
<p>7. And on account of the two conditions of standing and eating
(of which the former is characteristic of the highest Lord, the
latter of the individual soul).</p>
<p>With reference to that which is the abode of heaven, earth, and
so on, the text says, 'Two birds, inseparable friends,' &amp;c.
(Mu. Up. III, 1, 1). This passage describes the two states of mere
standing, i.e. mere presence, and of eating, the clause, 'One of
them eats the sweet fruit,' referring to the eating, i.e. the
fruition of the results of works, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page160" id="page160"></a>{160}</span> and the clause, 'The other
one looks on without eating,' describing the condition of mere
inactive presence. The two states described, viz. of mere presence
on the one hand and of enjoyment on the other hand, show that the
Lord and the individual soul are referred to. Now there is room for
this statement which represents the Lord as separate from the
individual soul, only if the passage about the abode of heaven and
earth likewise refers to the Lord; for in that case only there
exists a continuity of topic. On any other supposition the second
passage would contain a statement about something not connected
with the general topic, and would therefore be entirely uncalled
for.&mdash;But, it may be objected, on your interpretation also the
second passage makes an uncalled-for statement, viz. in so far as
it represents the individual soul as separate from the
Lord.&mdash;Not so, we reply. It is nowhere the purpose of
Scripture to make statements regarding the individual soul. From
ordinary experience the individual soul, which in the different
individual bodies is joined to the internal organs and other
limiting adjuncts, is known to every one as agent and enjoyer, and
we therefore must not assume that it is that which Scripture aims
at setting forth. The Lord, on the other hand, about whom ordinary
experience tells us nothing, is to be considered as the special
topic of all scriptural passages, and we therefore cannot assume
that any passage should refer to him merely casually<a id=
"footnotetag170" name="footnotetag170"></a><a href=
"#footnote170"><sup>170</sup></a>.&mdash;That <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>{161}</span> the
mantra 'two birds,' &amp;c. speaks of the Lord&mdash;and the
individual soul we have already shown under I, 2, 11.&mdash;And if,
according to the interpretation given in the Pai@ngi-upanishad (and
quoted under I, 2, 11), the verse is understood to refer to the
internal organ (sattva) and the individual soul (not to the
individual soul and the Lord), even then there is no contradiction
(between that interpretation and our present averment that the
individual soul is not the abode of heaven and earth).&mdash;How
so?&mdash;Here (i.e. in the present S&ucirc;tra and the
S&ucirc;tras immediately preceding) it is denied that the
individual soul which, owing to its imagined connexion with the
internal organ and other limiting adjuncts, has a separate
existence in separate bodies&mdash;its division being analogous to
the division of universal space into limited spaces such as the
spaces within jars and the like&mdash;is that which is called the
abode of heaven and earth. That same soul, on the other hand, which
exists in all bodies, if considered apart from the limiting
adjuncts, is nothing else but the highest Self. Just as the spaces
within jars, if considered apart from their limiting conditions,
are merged in universal space, so the individual soul also is
incontestably that which is denoted as the abode of heaven and
earth, since it (the soul) cannot really be separate from the
highest Self. That it is not the abode of heaven and earth, is
therefore said of the individual soul in so far only as it imagines
itself to be connected with the internal organ and so on. Hence it
follows that the highest Self is the abode of heaven, earth, and so
on.&mdash;The same conclusion has already been arrived at under I,
2, 21; for in the passage concerning the source of all beings
(which passage is discussed under the S&ucirc;tra quoted) we meet
with the clause, 'In which heaven and <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>{162}</span> earth and
the sky are woven.' In the present adhikara<i>n</i>a the subject is
resumed for the sake of further elucidation.</p>
<p>8. The bh&ucirc;man (is Brahman), as the instruction about it is
additional to that about the state of deep sleep (i.e. the vital
air which remains awake even in the state of deep sleep).</p>
<p>We read (Ch. Up. VII, 23; 24), 'That which is much
(bh&ucirc;man) we must desire to understand.&mdash;Sir, I desire to
understand it.&mdash;Where one sees nothing else, hears nothing
else, understands nothing else, that is what is much
(bh&ucirc;man). Where one sees something else, hears something
else, understands something else, that is the Little.'&mdash;Here
the doubt arises whether that which is much is the vital air
(pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a) or the highest Self.&mdash;Whence the
doubt?&mdash;The word 'bh&ucirc;man,' taken by itself, means the
state of being much, according to its derivation as taught by
P&acirc;<i>n</i>ani, VI, 4, 158. Hence there is felt the want of a
specification showing what constitutes the Self of that muchness.
Here there presents itself at first the approximate passage, 'The
vital air is more than hope' (Ch. Up. VII, 15, 1), from which we
may conclude that the vital air is bh&ucirc;man.&mdash;On the other
hand, we meet at the beginning of the chapter, where the general
topic is stated, with the following passage, 'I have heard from men
like you that he who knows the Self overcomes grief. I am in grief.
Do, Sir, help me over this grief of mine;' from which passage it
would appear that the bh&ucirc;man is the highest Self.&mdash;Hence
there arises a doubt as to which of the two alternatives is to be
embraced, and which is to be set aside.</p>
<p>The p&ucirc;rvapakshin maintains that the bh&ucirc;man is the
vital air, since there is found no further series of questions and
answers as to what is more. For while we meet with a series of
questions and answers (such as, 'Sir, is there something which is
more than a name?'&mdash;'Speech is more than name.'&mdash;'Is
there something which is more than speech?'&mdash;'Mind is more
than speech'), which extends from name up to vital air, we do not
meet with a similar question and answer as to what might be more
than vital air (such as, 'Is there something <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>{163}</span> which is
more than vital air?'&mdash;'Such and such a thing is more than
vital air'). The text rather at first declares at length (in the
passage, 'The vital air is more than hope,' &amp;c.) that the vital
air is more than all the members of the series from name up to
hope; it then acknowledges him who knows the vital air to be an
ativ&acirc;din, i.e. one who makes a statement surpassing the
preceding statements (in the passage, 'Thou art an ativ&acirc;din.
He may say I am an ativ&acirc;din; he need not deny it'); and it
thereupon (in the passage, 'But he in reality is an ativ&acirc;din
who declares something beyond by means of the True'<a id=
"footnotetag171" name="footnotetag171"></a><a href=
"#footnote171"><sup>171</sup></a>),&mdash;not leaving off, but
rather continuing to refer to the quality of an ativ&acirc;din
which is founded on the vital air,&mdash;proceeds, by means of the
series beginning with the True, to lead over to the bh&ucirc;man;
so that we conclude the meaning to be that the vital air is the
bh&ucirc;man.&mdash;But, if the bh&ucirc;man is interpreted to mean
the vital air, how have we to explain the passage in which the
bh&ucirc;man is characterised. 'Where one sees nothing else?'
&amp;c.&mdash;As, the p&ucirc;rvapakshin replies, in the state of
deep sleep we observe a cessation of all activity, such as seeing,
&amp;c., on the part of the organs merged in the vital air, the
vital air itself may be characterised by a passage such as, 'Where
one sees nothing else.' Similarly, another scriptural passage (Pra.
Up. IV, 2; 3) describes at first (in the words, 'He does not hear,
he does not see,' &amp;c.) the state of deep sleep as characterised
by the cessation of the activity of all bodily organs, and then by
declaring that in that state the vital air, with its five
modifications, remains awake ('The fires of the pr&acirc;<i>n</i>as
are awake in that town'), shows the vital air to occupy the
principal position in the state of deep sleep.&mdash;That passage
also, which speaks of the bliss of the bh&ucirc;man ('The
bh&ucirc;man is bliss,' Ch. Up. VII, 23), can be reconciled with
our explanation, because Pra. Up. IV, 6 declares bliss to attach to
the state of deep sleep ('Then that god sees no dreams and at that
time that happiness arises in his body').&mdash;Again, the
statement, 'The bh&ucirc;man is immortality' (Ch. Up. VII, 24, 1),
may <span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id=
"page164"></a>{164}</span> likewise refer to the vital air; for
another scriptural passage says, 'pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a is
immortality' (Kau. Up. III, 2).&mdash;But how can the view
according to which the bh&ucirc;man is the vital air be reconciled
with the fact that in the beginning of the chapter the knowledge of
the Self is represented as the general topic ('He who knows the
Self overcomes grief,' &amp;c.)?&mdash;By the Self there referred
to, the p&ucirc;rvapakshin replies, nothing else is meant but the
vital air. For the passage, 'The vital air is father, the vital air
is mother, the vital air is brother, the vital air is sister, the
vital air is teacher, the vital air is br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a' (Ch.
Up. VII, 15, 1), represents the vital air as the Self of
everything. As, moreover, the passage, 'As the spokes of a wheel
rest in the nave, so all this rests in pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a,'
declares the pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a to be the Self of all&mdash;by
means of a comparison with the spokes and the nave of a
wheel&mdash;the pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a may be conceived under the form
of bh&ucirc;man, i.e. plenitude.&mdash;Bh&ucirc;man, therefore,
means the vital air.</p>
<p>To this we make the following reply.&mdash;Bh&ucirc;man can mean
the highest Self only, not the vital air.&mdash;Why?&mdash;'On
account of information being given about it, subsequent to bliss.'
The word 'bliss' (sampras&acirc;da) means the state of deep sleep,
as may be concluded, firstly, from the etymology of the word ('In
it he, i.e. man, is altogether
pleased&mdash;sampras&icirc;dati')&mdash;and, secondly, from the
fact of sampras&acirc;da being mentioned in the
B<i>ri</i>had&acirc;ra<i>n</i>yaka together with the state of dream
and the waking state. And as in the state of deep sleep the vital
air remains awake, the word 'sampras&acirc;da' is employed in the
S&ucirc;tra to denote the vital air; so that the S&ucirc;tra means,
'on account of information being given about the bh&ucirc;man,
subsequently to (the information given about) the vital air.' If
the bh&ucirc;man were the vital air itself, it would be a strange
proceeding to make statements about the bh&ucirc;man in addition to
the statements about the vital air. For in the preceding passages
also we do not meet, for instance, with a statement about name
subsequent to the previous statement about name (i.e. the text does
not say 'name is more than name'), but after something has been
said about name, a new statement is <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page165" id="page165"></a>{165}</span> made about speech, which is
something different from name (i.e. the text says, 'Speech is more
than name'), and so on up to the statement about vital air, each
subsequent statement referring to something other than the topic of
the preceding one. We therefore conclude that the bh&ucirc;man
also, the statement about which follows on the statement about the
vital air, is something other than the vital air. But&mdash;it may
be objected&mdash;we meet here neither with a question, such as,
'Is there something more than vital air?' nor with an answer, such
as, 'That and that is more than vital air.' How, then, can it be
said that the information about the bh&ucirc;man is given
subsequently to the information about the vital
air?&mdash;Moreover, we see that the circumstance of being an
ativ&acirc;din, which is exclusively connected with the vital air,
is referred to in the subsequent passage (viz. 'But in reality he
is an ativ&acirc;din who makes a statement surpassing (the
preceding statements) by means of the True'). There is thus no
information additional to the information about the vital
air.&mdash;To this objection we reply that it is impossible to
maintain that the passage last quoted merely continues the
discussion of the quality of being an ativ&acirc;din, as connected
with the knowledge of the vital air; since the clause, 'He who
makes a statement surpassing, &amp;c. by means of the True,' states
a specification.&mdash;But, the objector resumes, this very
statement of a specification may be explained as referring to the
vital air. If you ask how, we refer you to an analogous case. If
somebody says, 'This Agnihotrin speaks the truth,' the meaning is
not that the quality of being an Agnihotrin depends on speaking the
truth; that quality rather depends on the (regular performance of
the) agnihotra only, and speaking the truth is mentioned merely as
a special attribute of that special Agnihotrin. So our passage also
('But in reality he is an ativ&acirc;din who makes a statement,
&amp;c. by means of the True') does not intimate that the quality
of being an ativ&acirc;din depends on speaking the truth, but
merely expresses that speaking the truth is a special attribute of
him who knows the vital air; while the quality of being an
ativ&acirc;din must be considered to depend on the knowledge of the
vital air.&mdash;This <span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id=
"page166"></a>{166}</span> objection we rebut by the remark that it
involves an abandonment of the direct meaning of the sacred text.
For from the text, as it stands, we understand that the quality of
being an ativ&acirc;din depends on speaking the truth; the sense
being: An ativ&acirc;din is he who is an ativ&acirc;din by means of
the True. The passage does not in anyway contain a eulogisation of
the knowledge of the vital air. It could be connected with the
latter only on the ground of general subject-matter
(prakara<i>n</i>a)<a id="footnotetag172" name=
"footnotetag172"></a><a href="#footnote172"><sup>172</sup></a>;
which would involve an abandonment of the direct meaning of the
text in favour of prakara<i>n</i>a<a id="footnotetag173" name=
"footnotetag173"></a><a href=
"#footnote173"><sup>173</sup></a>.&mdash;Moreover, the particle but
('But in reality he is,' &amp;c.), whose purport is to separate
(what follows) from the subject-matter of what precedes, would not
agree (with the pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a explanation). The following
passage also, 'But we must desire to know the True' (VII, 16),
which presupposes a new effort, shows that a new topic is going to
be entered upon.&mdash;For these reasons we have to consider the
statement about the ativ&acirc;din in the same light as we should
consider the remark&mdash;made in a conversation which previously
had turned on the praise of those who study one Veda&mdash;that he
who studies the four Vedas is a great br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a; a
remark which we should understand to be laudatory of persons
different from those who study one Veda, i.e. of those who study
all the four Vedas. Nor is there any reason to assume that a new
topic can be introduced in the form of question and answer only;
for that the matter propounded forms a new topic is sufficiently
clear from the circumstance that no connexion can be established
between it and the preceding topic. The succession of topics in the
chapter under discussion is as follows: N&acirc;rada at first
listens to the instruction which Sanatkum&acirc;ra gives him about
various matters, the last of which is pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a, and then
becomes silent. Thereupon Sanatkum&acirc;ra explains to him
spontaneously (without being <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page167" id="page167"></a>{167}</span> asked) that the quality of
being an ativ&acirc;din, if merely based on the knowledge of the
vital air&mdash;which knowledge has for its object an unreal
product,&mdash;is devoid of substance, and that he only is an
ativ&acirc;din who is such by means of the True. By the term 'the
True' there is meant the highest Brahman; for Brahman is the Real,
and it is called the 'True' in another scriptural passage also,
viz. Taitt. Up. II, 1, 'The True, knowledge, infinite is Brahman.'
N&acirc;rada, thus enlightened, starts a new line of enquiry
('Might I, Sir, become an ativ&acirc;din by the True?') and
Sanatkum&acirc;ra then leads him, by a series of instrumental
steps, beginning with understanding, up to the knowledge of
bh&ucirc;man. We therefrom conclude that the bh&ucirc;man is that
very True whose explanation had been promised in addition to the
(knowledge of the) vital air. We thus see that the instruction
about the bh&ucirc;man is additional to the instruction about the
vital air, and bh&ucirc;man must therefore mean the highest Self,
which is different from the vital air. With this interpretation the
initial statement, according to which the enquiry into the Self
forms the general subject-matter, agrees perfectly well. The
assumption, on the other hand (made by the p&ucirc;rvapakshin),
that by the Self we have here to understand the vital air is
indefensible. For, in the first place, Self-hood does not belong to
the vital air in any non-figurative sense. In the second place,
cessation of grief cannot take place apart from the knowledge of
the highest Self; for, as another scriptural passage declares,
'There is no other path to go' (<i>S</i>vet. Up. VI, 15). Moreover,
after we have read at the outset, 'Do, Sir, lead me over to the
other side of grief' (Ch. Up. VII, 1, 3), we meet with the
following concluding words (VII, 26, 2), 'To him, after his faults
had been rubbed out, the venerable Sanatkum&acirc;ra showed the
other side of darkness.' The term 'darkness' here denotes
Nescience, the cause of grief, and so on.&mdash;Moreover, if the
instruction terminated with the vital air, it would not be said of
the latter that it rests on something else. But the
br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a (Ch. Up. VII, 26, 1) does say, 'The vital air
springs from the Self.' Nor can it be objected against this last
argument that the concluding <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page168" id="page168"></a>{168}</span> part of the chapter may
refer to the highest Self, while, all the same, the bh&ucirc;man
(mentioned in an earlier part of the chapter) may be the vital air.
For, from the passage (VII, 24, 1), ('Sir, in what does the
bh&ucirc;man rest? In its own greatness,' &amp;c.), it appears that
the bh&ucirc;man forms the continuous topic up to the end of the
chapter.&mdash;The quality of being the bh&ucirc;man&mdash;which
quality is plenitude&mdash;agrees, moreover, best with the highest
Self, which is the cause of everything.</p>
<p>9. And on account of the agreement of the attributes (mentioned
in the text).</p>
<p>The attributes, moreover, which the sacred text ascribes to the
bh&ucirc;man agree well with the highest Self. The passage, 'Where
one sees nothing else, hears nothing else, understands nothing
else, that is the bh&ucirc;man,' gives us to understand that in the
bh&ucirc;man the ordinary activities of seeing and so on are
absent; and that this is characteristic of the highest Self, we
know from another scriptural passage, viz. 'But when the Self only
is all this, how should he see another?' &amp;c. (B<i>ri</i>. Up.
IV, 5, 15). What is said about the absence of the activities of
seeing and so on in the state of deep sleep (Pra. Up. IV, 2) is
said with the intention of declaring the non-attachedness of the
Self, not of describing the nature of the pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a; for
the highest Self (not the vital air) is the topic of that passage.
The bliss also of which Scripture speaks as connected with that
state is mentioned only in order to show that bliss constitutes the
nature of the Self. For Scripture says (B<i>ri</i>. Up. IV, 3, 32),
'This is his highest bliss. All other creatures live on a small
portion of that bliss.'&mdash;The passage under discussion also
('The bh&ucirc;man is bliss. There is no bliss in that which is
little (limited). The bh&ucirc;man only is bliss') by denying the
reality of bliss on the part of whatever is perishable shows that
Brahman only is bliss as bh&ucirc;man, i.e. in its
plenitude,&mdash;Again, the passage, 'The bh&ucirc;man is
immortality,' shows that the highest cause is meant; for the
immortality of all effected things is a merely relative one,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id=
"page169"></a>{169}</span> and another scriptural passage says that
'whatever is different from that (Brahman) is perishable'
(B<i>ri</i>. Up. III, 4, 2).&mdash;Similarly, the qualities of
being the True, and of resting in its own greatness, and of being
omnipresent, and of being the Self of everything which the text
mentions (as belonging to the bh&ucirc;man) can belong to the
highest Self only, not to anything else.&mdash;By all this it is
proved that the bh&ucirc;man is the highest Self.</p>
<p>10. The Imperishable (is Brahman) on account of (its) supporting
(all things) up to ether.</p>
<p>We read (B<i>ri</i>. Up. III, 8, 7; 8). 'In what then is the
ether woven, like warp and woof?&mdash;He said: O
G&acirc;rg&icirc;, the br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>as call this the akshara
(the Imperishable). It is neither coarse nor fine,' and so
on.&mdash;Here the doubt arises whether the word 'akshara' means
'syllable' or 'the highest Lord.'</p>
<p>The p&ucirc;rvapakshin maintains that the word 'akshara' means
'syllable' merely, because it has, in such terms as
akshara-sam&acirc;mn&acirc;ya, the meaning of 'syllable;' because
we have no right to disregard the settled meaning of a word; and
because another scriptural passage also ('The syllable Om is all
this,' Ch. Up. II, 23, 4) declares a syllable, represented as the
object of devotion, to be the Self of all.</p>
<p>To this we reply that the highest Self only is denoted by the
word 'akshara.'&mdash;Why?&mdash;Because it (the akshara) is said
to support the entire aggregate of effects, from earth up to ether.
For the sacred text declares at first that the entire aggregate of
effects beginning with earth and differentiated by threefold time
is based on ether, in which it is 'woven like warp and woof;' leads
then (by means of the question, 'In what then is the ether woven,
like warp and woof?') over to the akshara, and, finally, concludes
with the words, 'In that akshara then, O G&acirc;rg&icirc;, the
ether is woven, like warp and woof.'&mdash;Now the attribute of
supporting everything up to ether cannot be ascribed to any being
but Brahman. The text (quoted from the Ch. Up.) says indeed that
the syllable Om is all this, but that statement <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>{170}</span> is to be
understood as a mere glorification of the syllable Om considered as
a means to obtain Brahman.&mdash;Therefore we take akshara to mean
either 'the Imperishable' or 'that which pervades;' on the ground
of either of which explanations it must be identified with the
highest Brahman.</p>
<p>But&mdash;our opponent resumes&mdash;while we must admit that
the above reasoning holds good so far that the circumstance of the
akshara supporting all things up to ether is to be accepted as a
proof of all effects depending on a cause, we point out that it may
be employed by those also who declare the pradh&acirc;na to be the
general cause. How then does the previous argumentation specially
establish Brahman (to the exclusion of the
pradh&acirc;na)?&mdash;The reply to this is given in the next
S&ucirc;tra.</p>
<p>11. This (supporting can), on account of the command (attributed
to the Imperishable, be the work of the highest Lord only).</p>
<p>The supporting of all things up to ether is the work of the
highest Lord only.&mdash;Why?&mdash;On account of the
command.&mdash;For the sacred text speaks of a command ('By the
command of that akshara, O G&acirc;rg&icirc;, sun and moon stand
apart!' III, 8, 9), and command can be the work of the highest Lord
only, not of the non-intelligent pradh&acirc;na. For
non-intelligent causes such as clay and the like are not capable of
command, with reference to their effects, such as jars and the
like.</p>
<p>12. And on account of (Scripture) separating (the akshara) from
that whose nature is different (from Brahman).</p>
<p>Also on account of the reason stated in this S&ucirc;tra Brahman
only is to be considered as the Imperishable, and the supporting of
all things up to ether is to be looked upon as the work of Brahman
only, not of anything else. The meaning of the S&ucirc;tra is as
follows. Whatever things other than Brahman might possibly be
thought to be denoted by the term 'akshara,' from the nature of all
those things Scripture separates the akshara spoken of as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id=
"page171"></a>{171}</span> support of all things up to ether. The
scriptural passage alluded to is III, 8, 11, 'That akshara, O
G&acirc;rg&icirc;, is unseen but seeing, unheard but hearing,
unperceived but perceiving, unknown but knowing.' Here the
designation of being unseen, &amp;c. agrees indeed with the
pradh&acirc;na also, but not so the designation of seeing, &amp;c.,
as the pradh&acirc;na is non-intelligent.&mdash;Nor can the word
akshara denote the embodied soul with its limiting conditions, for
the passage following on the one quoted declares that there is
nothing different from the Self ('there is nothing that sees but
it, nothing that hears but it, nothing that perceives but it,
nothing that knows but it'); and, moreover, limiting conditions are
expressly denied (of the akshara) in the passage, 'It is without
eyes, without ears, without speech, without mind,' &amp;c. (III, 8,
8). An embodied soul without limiting conditions does not
exist<a id="footnotetag174" name="footnotetag174"></a><a href=
"#footnote174"><sup>174</sup></a>.&mdash;It is therefore certain
beyond doubt that the Imperishable is nothing else but the highest
Brahman.</p>
<p>13. On account of his being designated as the object of sight
(the highest Self is meant, and) the same (is meant in the passage
speaking of the meditation on the highest person by means of the
syllable Om).</p>
<p>(In Pra. Up. V, 2) the general topic of discussion is set forth
in the words, 'O Satyak&acirc;ma, the syllable Om is the highest
and also the other Brahman; therefore he who knows it arrives by
the same means at one of the two.' The text then goes on, 'Again,
he who meditates with this syllable Om of three m&acirc;tr&acirc;s
on the highest Person,' &amp;c.&mdash;Here the doubt presents
itself, whether the object of meditation referred to in the latter
passage is the highest Brahman or the other Brahman; a doubt based
on the former passage, according to which both are under
discussion.</p>
<p>The p&ucirc;rvapakshin maintains that the other, i.e. the lower
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id=
"page172"></a>{172}</span> Brahman, is referred to, because the
text promises only a reward limited by a certain locality for him
who knows it. For, as the highest Brahman is omnipresent, it would
be inappropriate to assume that he who knows it obtains a fruit
limited by a certain locality. The objection that, if the lower
Brahman were understood, there would be no room for the
qualification, 'the highest person,' is not valid, because the
vital principal (pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a) may be called 'higher' with
reference to the body<a id="footnotetag175" name=
"footnotetag175"></a><a href="#footnote175"><sup>175</sup></a>.</p>
<p>To this we make the following reply: What is here taught as the
object of meditation is the highest Brahman
only.&mdash;Why?&mdash;On account of its being spoken of as the
object of sight. For the person to be meditated upon is, in a
complementary passage, spoken of as the object of the act of
seeing, 'He sees the person dwelling in the castle (of the body;
purusham puri<i>s</i>ayam), higher than that one who is of the
shape of the individual soul, and who is himself higher (than the
senses and their objects).' Now, of an act of meditation an unreal
thing also can be the object, as, for instance, the merely
imaginary object of a wish. But of the act of seeing, real things
only are the objects, as we know from experience; we therefore
conclude, that in the passage last quoted, the highest (only real)
Self which corresponds to the mental act of complete
intuition<a id="footnotetag176" name="footnotetag176"></a><a href=
"#footnote176"><sup>176</sup></a> is spoken of as the object of
sight. This same highest Self we recognise in the passage under
discussion as the object of meditation, in consequence of the term,
'the highest person.'&mdash;But&mdash;an objection will be
raised&mdash;as the object of meditation we have the highest
person, and as the object of sight the person higher than that one
who is himself higher, &amp;c.; how, then, are we to know that
those two are identical?&mdash;The two passages, we <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>{173}</span> reply,
have in common the terms 'highest' (or 'higher,' para) and
'person.' And it must not by any means be supposed that the term
j&icirc;vaghana<a id="footnotetag177" name=
"footnotetag177"></a><a href="#footnote177"><sup>177</sup></a>
refers to that highest person which, considered as the object of
meditation, had previously been introduced as the general topic.
For the consequence of that supposition would be that that highest
person which is the object of sight would be different from that
highest person which is represented as the object of meditation. We
rather have to explain the word j&icirc;vaghana as 'He whose
shape<a id="footnotetag178" name="footnotetag178"></a><a href=
"#footnote178"><sup>178</sup></a> is characterised by the
j&icirc;vas;' so that what is really meant by that term is that
limited condition of the highest Self which is owing to its
adjuncts, and manifests itself in the form of j&icirc;vas, i.e.
individual souls; a condition analogous to the limitation of salt
(in general) by means of the mass of a particular lump of salt.
That limited condition of the Self may itself be called 'higher,'
if viewed with regard to the senses and their objects.</p>
<p>Another (commentator) says that we have to understand by the
word 'j&icirc;vaghana' the world of Brahman spoken of in the
preceding sentence ('by the S&acirc;man verses he is led up to the
world of Brahman'), and again in the following sentence (v. 7),
which may be called 'higher,' because it is higher than the other
worlds. That world of Brahman may be called j&icirc;vaghana because
all individual souls (j&icirc;va) with their organs of action may
be viewed as comprised (sa@ngh&acirc;ta = ghana) within
Hira<i>n</i>yagarbha, who is the Self of all organs, and dwells in
the Brahma-world. We thus understand that he who is higher than
that j&icirc;vaghana, i.e. the highest Self, which constitutes the
object of sight, also constitutes the object of meditation. The
qualification, moreover, expressed in the term 'the highest person'
is in its place only if we understand the highest Self to be meant.
For the name, 'the highest person,' can be given only to the
highest Self, higher than which there is nothing. So another
scriptural passage also says, 'Higher than the person there is
nothing&mdash;this is the goal, the highest road.' Hence the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id=
"page174"></a>{174}</span> sacred text, which at first
distinguishes between the higher and the lower Brahman ('the
syllable Om is the higher and the lower Brahman'), and afterwards
speaks of the highest Person to be meditated upon by means of the
syllable Om, gives us to understand that the highest Person is
nothing else but the highest Brahman. That the highest Self
constitutes the object of meditation, is moreover intimated by the
passage declaring that release from evil is the fruit (of
meditation), 'As a snake is freed from its skin, so is he freed
from evil.'&mdash;With reference to the objection that a fruit
confined to a certain place is not an appropriate reward for him
who meditates on the highest Self, we finally remark that the
objection is removed, if we understand the passage to refer to
emancipation by degrees. He who meditates on the highest Self by
means of the syllable Om, as consisting of three
m&acirc;tr&acirc;s, obtains for his (first) reward the world of
Brahman, and after that, gradually, complete intuition.</p>
<p>14. The small (ether) (is Brahman) on account of the subsequent
(arguments).</p>
<p>We read (Ch. Up. VIII, 1, 1), 'There is this city of Brahman,
and in it the palace, the small lotus, and in it that small ether.
Now what exists within that small ether that is to be sought for,
that is to be understood,' &amp;c.&mdash;Here the doubt arises
whether the small ether within the small lotus of the heart of
which Scripture speaks, is the elemental ether, or the individual
soul (vij<i>&ntilde;</i>&acirc;n&acirc;tman), or the highest Self.
This doubt is caused by the words 'ether' and 'city of Brahman.'
For the word 'ether,' in the first place, is known to be used in
the sense of elemental ether as well as of highest Brahman. Hence
the doubt whether the small ether of the text be the elemental
ether or the highest ether, i.e. Brahman. In explanation of the
expression 'city of Brahman,' in the second place, it might be said
either that the individual soul is here called Brahman and the body
Brahman's city, or else that the city of Brahman means the city of
the highest Brahman. Here (i.e. in consequence of this latter
doubt) a further doubt arises as to <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page175" id="page175"></a>{175}</span> the nature of the small
ether, according as the individual soul or the highest Self is
understood by the Lord of the city.</p>
<p>The p&ucirc;rvapakshin maintains that by the small ether we have
to understand the elemental ether, since the latter meaning is the
conventional one of the word &acirc;k&acirc;<i>s</i>a. The
elemental ether is here called small with reference to its small
abode (the heart).&mdash;In the passage, 'As large as this ether
is, so large is that ether within the heart,' it is represented as
constituting at the same time the two terms of a comparison,
because it is possible to make a distinction between the outer and
the inner ether<a id="footnotetag179" name=
"footnotetag179"></a><a href="#footnote179"><sup>179</sup></a>; and
it is said that 'heaven and earth are contained within it,' because
the whole ether, in so far as it is space, is one<a id=
"footnotetag180" name="footnotetag180"></a><a href=
"#footnote180"><sup>180</sup></a>.&mdash;Or else, the
p&ucirc;rvapakshin continues, the 'small one' may be taken to mean
the individual soul, on account of the term, 'the city of Brahman.'
The body is here called the city of Brahman because it is the abode
of the individual soul; for it is acquired by means of the actions
of the soul. On this interpretation we must assume that the
individual soul is here called Brahman metaphorically. The highest
Brahman cannot be meant, because it is not connected with the body
as its lord. The lord of the city, i.e. the soul, is represented as
dwelling in one spot of the city (viz. the heart), just as a real
king resides in one spot of his residence. Moreover, the mind
(manas) constitutes the limiting adjunct of the individual soul,
and the mind chiefly abides in the heart; hence the individual soul
only can be spoken of as dwelling in the heart. Further, the
individual soul only can be spoken of as small, since it is
(elsewhere; <i>S</i>vet. Up. V, 8) compared in size to the point of
a goad. That it is compared (in the passage under discussion) to
the ether must be understood to intimate its non difference from
Brahman.&mdash;Nor <span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id=
"page176"></a>{176}</span> does the scriptural passage say that the
'small' one is to be sought for and to be understood, since in the
clause, 'That which is within that,' &amp;c., it is represented as
a mere distinguishing attribute of something else<a id=
"footnotetag181" name="footnotetag181"></a><a href=
"#footnote181"><sup>181</sup></a>.</p>
<p>To all this we make the following reply:&mdash;The small ether
can mean the highest Lord only, not either the elemental ether or
the individual soul.&mdash;Why?&mdash;On account of the subsequent
reasons, i.e. on account of the reasons implied in the
complementary passage. For there, the text declares at first, with
reference to the small ether, which is enjoined as the object of
sight, 'If they should say to him,' &amp;c.; thereupon follows an
objection, 'What is there that deserves to be sought for or that is
to be understood?' and thereon a final decisive statement, 'Then he
should say: As large as this ether is, so large is that ether
within the heart. Both heaven and earth are contained within it.'
Here the teacher, availing himself of the comparison of the ether
within the heart with the known (universal) ether, precludes the
conception that the ether within the heart is small&mdash;which
conception is based on the statement as to the smallness of the
lotus, i.e. the heart&mdash;and thereby precludes the possibility
of our understanding by the term 'the small ether,' the elemental
ether. For, although the ordinary use of language gives to the word
'ether' the sense of elemental ether, here the elemental ether
cannot be thought of, because it cannot possibly be compared with
itself.&mdash;But, has it not been stated above, that the ether,
although one only, may be compared with itself, in consequence of
an assumed difference between the outer and the inner
ether?&mdash;That explanation, we reply, is impossible; for we
cannot admit that a comparison of a thing with itself may be based
upon a merely imaginary difference. And even if we admitted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id=
"page177"></a>{177}</span> the possibility of such a comparison,
the extent of the outer ether could never be ascribed to the
limited inner ether. Should it be said that to the highest Lord
also the extent of the (outer) ether cannot be ascribed, since
another scriptural passage declares that he is greater than ether
(<i>S</i>a. Br&acirc;, X, 6, 3, 2), we invalidate this objection by
the remark, that the passage (comparing the inner ether with the
outer ether) has the purport of discarding the idea of smallness
(of the inner ether), which is prim&acirc; facie established by the
smallness of the lotus of the heart in which it is contained, and
has not the purport of establishing a certain extent (of the inner
ether). If the passage aimed at both, a split of the sentence<a id=
"footnotetag182" name="footnotetag182"></a><a href=
"#footnote182"><sup>182</sup></a> would result.&mdash;Nor, if we
allowed the assumptive difference of the inner and the outer ether,
would it be possible to represent that limited portion of the ether
which is enclosed in the lotus of the heart, as containing within
itself heaven, earth, and so on. Nor can we reconcile with the
nature of the elemental ether the qualities of Self-hood, freeness
from sin, and so on, (which are ascribed to the 'small' ether) in
the following passage, 'It is the Self free from sin, free from old
age, from death and grief, from hunger and thirst, of true desires,
of true purposes.'&mdash;Although the term 'Self' (occurring in the
passage quoted) may apply to the individual soul, yet other reasons
exclude all idea of the individual soul being meant (by the small
ether). For it would be impossible to dissociate from the
individual soul, which is restricted by limiting conditions and
elsewhere compared to the point of a goad, the attribute of
smallness attaching to it, on account of its being enclosed in the
lotus of the heart.&mdash;Let it then be assumed&mdash;our opponent
remarks&mdash;that the qualities of all-pervadingness, &amp;c. are
ascribed to the individual soul with the intention of intimating
its non-difference from Brahman.&mdash;Well, we reply, if you
suppose that the small ether is called all-pervading because it is
one with Brahman, our own supposition, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>{178}</span> viz. that
the all-pervadingness spoken of is directly predicated of Brahman
itself, is the much more simple one.&mdash;Concerning the assertion
that the term 'city of Brahman' can only be understood, on the
assumption that the individual soul dwells, like a king, in one
particular spot of the city of which it is the Lord, we remark that
the term is more properly interpreted to mean 'the body in so far
as it is the city of the highest Brahman;' which interpretation
enables us to take the term 'Brahman' in its primary sense<a id=
"footnotetag183" name="footnotetag183"></a><a href=
"#footnote183"><sup>183</sup></a>. The highest Brahman also is
connected with the body, for the latter constitutes an abode for
the perception of Brahman<a id="footnotetag184" name=
"footnotetag184"></a><a href="#footnote184"><sup>184</sup></a>.
Other scriptural passages also express the same meaning, so, for
instance, Pra. Up. V, 5, 'He sees the highest person dwelling in
the city' (purusha = puri<i>s</i>aya), &amp;c., and B<i>ri</i>. Up.
II, 5, 18, 'This person (purusha) is in all cities (bodies) the
dweller within the city (puri<i>s</i>aya).'&mdash;Or else (taking
brahmapura to mean j&icirc;vapura) we may understand the passage to
teach that Brahman is, in the city of the individual soul, near (to
the devout worshipper), just as Vish<i>n</i>u is near to us in the
S&acirc;lagr&acirc;ma-stone.&mdash;Moreover, the text (VIII, 1, 6)
at first declares the result of works to be perishable ('as here on
earth whatever has been acquired by works perishes, so perishes
whatever is acquired for the next world by good actions,' &amp;c.),
and afterwards declares the imperishableness of the results flowing
from a knowledge of the small ether, which forms the general
subject of discussion ('those who depart from hence after having
discovered the Self and those true desires, for them there is
freedom in all worlds'). From this again it is manifest that the
small ether is the highest Self.&mdash;We now turn to the statement
made by the p&ucirc;rvapakshin,'that the sacred text does not
represent the small ether as that <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page179" id="page179"></a>{179}</span> which is to be sought for
and to be understood, because it is mentioned as a distinguishing
attribute of something else,' and reply as follows: If the (small)
ether were not that which is to be sought for and to be understood,
the description of the nature of that ether, which is given in the
passage ('as large as this ether is, so large is that ether within
the heart'), would be devoid of purport.&mdash;But&mdash;the
opponent might say&mdash;that descriptive statement also has the
purport of setting forth the nature of the thing abiding within
(the ether); for the text after having raised an objection (in the
passage, 'And if they should say to him: Now with regard to that
city of Brahman and the palace in it, i.e. the small lotus of the
heart, and the small ether within the heart, what is there within
it that deserves to be sought for or that is to be understood?')
declares, when replying to that objection, that heaven, earth, and
so on, are contained within it (the ether), a declaration to which
the comparison with the ether forms a mere introduction.&mdash;Your
reasoning, we reply, is faulty. If it were admitted, it would
follow that heaven, earth, &amp;c., which are contained within the
small ether, constitute the objects of search and enquiry. But in
that case the complementary passage would be out of place. For the
text carrying on, as the subject of discussion, the ether that is
the abode of heaven, earth, &amp;c.&mdash;by means of the clauses,
'In it all desires are contained,' 'It is the Self free from sin,'
&amp;c., and the passage, 'But those who depart from hence having
discovered the Self, and the true desires' (in which passage the
conjunction 'and' has the purpose of joining the desires to the
Self)&mdash;declares that the Self as well, which is the abode of
the desires, as the desires which abide in the Self, are the
objects of knowledge. From this we conclude that in the beginning
of the passage also, the small ether abiding within the lotus of
the heart, together with whatever is contained within it as earth,
true desires, and so on, is represented as the object of knowledge.
And, for the reasons explained, that ether is the highest Lord.</p>
<p>15. (The small ether is Brahman) on account of <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>{180}</span> the
action of going (into Brahman) and of the word (brahmaloka); for
thus it is seen (i.e. that the individual souls go into Brahman is
seen elsewhere in Scripture); and (this going of the souls into
Brahman constitutes) an inferential sign (by means of which we may
properly interpret the word 'brahmaloka').</p>
<p>It has been declared (in the preceding S&ucirc;tra) that the
small (ether) is the highest Lord, on account of the reasons
contained in the subsequent passages. These subsequent reasons are
now set forth.&mdash;For this reason also the small (ether) can be
the highest Lord only, because the passage complementary to the
passage concerning the small (ether) contains a mention of going
and a word, both of which intimate the highest Lord. In the first
place, we read (Ch. Up. VIII, 3, 2), 'All these creatures, day
after day going into that Brahma-world, do not discover it.' This
passage which refers back, by means of the word 'Brahma-world,' to
the small ether which forms the general subject-matter, speaks of
the going to it of the creatures, i.e. the individual souls,
wherefrom we conclude that the small (ether) is Brahman. For this
going of the individual souls into Brahman, which takes place day
after day in the state of deep sleep, is seen, i.e. is met with in
another scriptural passage, viz. Ch. Up. VI, 8, 1, 'He becomes
united with the True,' &amp;c. In ordinary life also we say of a
man who lies in deep sleep, 'he has become Brahman,' 'he is gone
into the state of Brahman.'&mdash;In the second place, the word
'Brahma-world,' which is here applied to the small (ether) under
discussion, excludes all thought of the individual soul or the
elemental ether, and thus gives us to understand that the small
(ether) is Brahman.&mdash;But could not the word 'Brahma-world'
convey as well the idea of the world of him whose throne is the
lotus<a id="footnotetag185" name="footnotetag185"></a><a href=
"#footnote185"><sup>185</sup></a>?&mdash;It might do so indeed, if
we explained the compound 'Brahma-world' as 'the world of Brahman.'
But if we explain it on the ground of the coordination of both
members of the compound&mdash;so that <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>{181}</span>
'Brahma-world' denotes that world which is Brahman&mdash;then it
conveys the idea of the highest Brahman only.&mdash;And that daily
going (of the souls) into Brahman (mentioned above) is, moreover,
an inferential sign for explaining the compound 'Brahma-world,' on
the ground of the co-ordination of its two constituent members. For
it would be impossible to assume that all those creatures daily go
into the world of the effected (lower) Brahman; which world is
commonly called the Satyaloka, i.e. the world of the True.</p>
<p>16. And on account of the supporting also (attributed to it),
(the small ether must be the Lord) because that greatness is
observed in him (according to other scriptural passages).</p>
<p>And also on account of the 'supporting' the small ether can be
the highest Lord only.&mdash;How?&mdash;The text at first
introduces the general subject of discussion in the passage, 'In it
is that small ether;' declares thereupon that the small one is to
be compared with the universal ether, and that everything is
contained in it; subsequently applies to it the term 'Self,' and
states it to possess the qualities of being free from sin, &amp;c.;
and, finally, declares with reference to the same general subject
of discussion, 'That Self is a bank, a limitary support
(vidh<i>ri</i>ti), that these worlds may not be confounded.' As
'support' is here predicated of the Self, we have to understand by
it a supporting agent. Just as a dam stems the spreading water so
that the boundaries of the fields are not confounded, so that Self
acts like a limitary dam in order that these outer and inner
worlds, and all the different castes and &acirc;<i>s</i>ramas may
not be confounded. In accordance with this our text declares that
greatness, which is shown in the act of holding asunder, to belong
to the small (ether) which forms the subject of discussion; and
that such greatness is found in the highest Lord only, is seen from
other scriptural passages, such as 'By the command of that
Imperishable, O G&acirc;rg&icirc;, sun and moon; are held apart'
(B<i>ri</i>. Up. III, 8, 9). Similarly, we read in another passage
also, about whose referring to the highest <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>{182}</span> Lord
there is no doubt, 'He is the Lord of all, the king of all things,
the protector of all things. He is a bank and a limitary support,
so that these worlds may not be confounded' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. IV, 4,
22)&mdash;Hence, on account of the 'supporting,' also the small
(ether) is nothing else but the highest Lord.</p>
<p>17. And on account of the settled meaning.</p>
<p>The small ether within cannot denote anything but the highest
Lord for this reason also, that the word 'ether' has (among other
meanings) the settled meaning of 'highest Lord.' Compare, for
instance, the sense in which the word 'ether' is used in Ch. Up.
VIII, 14, 'He who is called ether is the revealer of all forms and
names;' and Ch. Up. I, 9, 1, 'All these beings take their rise from
the ether,' &amp;c. On the other hand, we do not meet with any
passage in which the word 'ether' is used in the sense of
'individual soul.'&mdash;We have already shown that the word
cannot, in our passage, denote the elemental ether; for, although
the word certainly has that settled meaning, it cannot have it
here, because the elemental ether cannot possibly be compared to
itself, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p>18. If it be said that the other one (i.e. the individual soul)
(is meant) on account of a reference to it (made in a complementary
passage), (we say) no, on account of the impossibility.</p>
<p>If the small (ether) is to be explained as the highest Lord on
account of a complementary passage, then, the p&ucirc;rvapakshin
resumes, we point out that another complementary passage contains a
reference to the other one, i.e. to the individual soul: 'Now that
serene being (literally: serenity, complete satisfaction), which
after having risen out from this earthly body and having reached
the highest light, appears in its true form, that is, the Self;
thus he spoke' (Ch. Up. VIII, 3, 4). For there the word 'serenity,'
which is known to denote, in another scriptural passage, the state
of deep sleep, can convey the idea of the individual soul only when
it is in <span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id=
"page183"></a>{183}</span> that state, not of anything else. The
'rising from the body' also can be predicated of the individual
soul only whose abode the body is; just as air, &amp;c., whose
abode is the ether, are said to arise from the ether. And just as
the word 'ether,' although in ordinary language not denoting the
highest Lord, yet is admitted to denote him in such passages as,
'The ether is the revealer of forms and names,' because it there
occurs in conjunction with qualities of the highest Lord, so it may
likewise denote the individual soul Hence the term 'the small
ether' denotes in the passage under discussion the individual soul,
'on account of the reference to the other.'</p>
<p>Not so, we reply, 'on account of the impossibility.' In the
first place, the individual soul, which imagines itself to be
limited by the internal organ and its other adjuncts, cannot be
compared with the ether. And, in the second place, attributes such
as freedom from evil, and the like, cannot be ascribed to a being
which erroneously transfers to itself the attributes of its
limiting adjuncts. This has already been set forth in the first
S&ucirc;tra of the present adhikara<i>n</i>a, and is again
mentioned here in order to remove all doubt as to the soul being
different from the highest Self. That the reference pointed out by
the p&ucirc;rvapakshin is not to the individual soul will,
moreover, be shown in one of the next S&ucirc;tras (I, 3, 21).</p>
<p>19. If it be said that from the subsequent (chapter it appears
that the individual soul is meant), (we point out that what is
there referred to is) rather (the individual soul in so far) as its
true nature has become manifest (i.e. as it is non-different from
Brahman).</p>
<p>The doubt whether, 'on account of the reference to the other,'
the individual soul might not possibly be meant, has been discarded
on the ground of 'impossibility.' But, like a dead man on whom
am<i>ri</i>ta has been sprinkled, that doubt rises again, drawing
new strength from the subsequent chapter which treats of
Praj&acirc;pati. For there he (Praj&acirc;pati) <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>{184}</span> at the
outset declares that the Self, which is free from sin and the like,
is that which is to be searched out, that which we must try to
understand (Ch. Up. VIII, 7, 1); after that he points out that the
seer within the eye, i.e. the individual soul, is the Self ('that
person that is seen in the eye is the Self,' VIII, 7, 3); refers
again and again to the same entity (in the clauses 'I shall explain
him further to you,' VIII, 9, 3; VIII, 10, 4); and (in the
explanations fulfilling the given promises) again explains the
(nature of the) same individual soul in its different states ('He
who moves about happy in dreams is the Self,' VIII, 10, 1; 'When a
man being asleep, reposing, and at perfect rest sees no dreams,
that is the Self,' VIII, 11, 1). The clause attached to both these
explanations (viz. 'That is the immortal, the fearless; that is
Brahman') shows, at the same time, the individual soul to be free
from sin, and the like. After that Praj&acirc;pati, having
discovered a shortcoming in the condition of deep sleep (in
consequence of the expostulation of Indra, 'In that way he does not
know himself that he is I, nor does he know these beings,' VIII,
11, 2), enters on a further explanation ('I shall explain him
further to you, and nothing more than this'), begins by blaming the
(soul's) connexion with the body, and finally declares the
individual soul, when it has risen from the body, to be the highest
person. ('Thus does that serene being, arising from this body,
appear in its own form as soon as it has approached the highest
light. That is the highest person.')&mdash;From this it appears
that there is a possibility of the qualities of the highest Lord
belonging to the individual soul also, and on that account we
maintain that the term, 'the small ether within it,' refers to the
individual soul.</p>
<p>This position we counter-argue as follows. 'But in so far as its
nature has become manifest.' The particle 'but' (in the
S&ucirc;tra) is meant to set aside the view of the
p&ucirc;rvapakshin, so that the sense of the S&ucirc;tra is, 'Not
even on account of the subsequent chapter a doubt as to the small
ether being the individual soul is possible, because there also
that which is meant to be intimated is the individual soul, in so
far only as its (true) nature has become manifest.' The S&ucirc;tra
uses the expression 'he whose nature has become manifest,'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id=
"page185"></a>{185}</span> which qualifies j&icirc;va., the
individual soul, with reference to its previous condition<a id=
"footnotetag186" name="footnotetag186"></a><a href=
"#footnote186"><sup>186</sup></a>.&mdash;The meaning is as follows.
Praj&acirc;pati speaks at first of the seer characterised by the
eye ('That person which is within the eye,' &amp;c.); shows
thereupon, in the passage treating of (the reflection in) the
waterpan, that he (viz. the seer) has not his true Self in the
body; refers to him repeatedly as the subject to be explained (in
the clauses 'I shall explain him further to you'); and having then
spoken of him as subject to the states of dreaming and deep sleep,
finally explains the individual soul in its real nature, i.e. in so
far as it is the highest Brahman, not in so far as it is individual
soul ('As soon as it has approached the highest light it appears in
its own form'). The highest light mentioned, in the passage last
quoted, as what is to be approached, is nothing else but the
highest Brahman, which is distinguished by such attributes as
freeness from sin, and the like. That same highest Brahman
constitutes&mdash;as we know from passages such as 'that art
thou'&mdash;the real nature of the individual soul, while its
second nature, i.e. that aspect of it which depends on fictitious
limiting conditions, is not its real nature. For as long as the
individual soul does not free itself from Nescience in the form of
duality&mdash;which Nescience may be compared to the mistake of him
who in the twilight mistakes a post for a man&mdash;and does not
rise to the knowledge of the Self, whose nature is unchangeable,
eternal Cognition&mdash;which expresses itself in the form 'I am
Brahman'&mdash;so long it remains the individual soul. But when,
discarding the aggregate of body, sense-organs and mind, it
arrives, by means of Scripture, at the knowledge that it is not
itself that aggregate, that it does not form part of transmigratory
existence, but is the True, the Real, the Self, whose nature is
pure intelligence; then <span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id=
"page186"></a>{186}</span> knowing itseif to be of the nature of
unchangeable, eternal Cognition, it lifts itself above the vain
conceit of being one with this body, and itself becomes the Self,
whose nature is unchanging, eternal Cognition. As is declared in
such scriptural passages as 'He who knows the highest Brahman
becomes even Brahman' (Mu. Up. III, 2, 9). And this is the real
nature of the individual soul by means of which it arises from the
body and appears in its own form.</p>
<p>Here an objection may be raised. How, it is asked, can we speak
of the true nature (svar&ucirc;pa) of that which is unchanging and
eternal, and then say that 'it appears in its own form (true
nature)?' Of gold and similar substances, whose true nature becomes
hidden, and whose specific qualities are rendered non-apparent by
their contact with some other substance, it may be said that their
true nature is rendered manifest when they are cleaned by the
application of some acid substance; so it may be said, likewise,
that the stars, whose light is during daytime overpowered (by the
superior brilliancy of the sun), become manifest in their true
nature at night when the overpowering (sun) has departed. But it is
impossible to speak of an analogous overpowering of the eternal
light of intelligence by whatever agency, since, like ether, it is
free from all contact, and since, moreover, such an assumption
would be contradicted by what we actually observe. For the
(energies of) seeing, hearing, noticing, cognising constitute the
character of the individual soul, and that character is observed to
exist in full perfection, even in the case of that individual soul
which has not yet risen beyond the body. Every individual soul
carries on the course of its practical existence by means of the
activities of seeing, hearing, cognising; otherwise no practical
existence at all would be possible. If, on the other hand, that
character would realise itself in the case of that soul only which
has risen above the body, the entire aggregate of practical
existence, as it actually presents itself prior to the soul's
rising, would thereby be contradicted. We therefore ask: Wherein
consists that (alleged) rising from the body? Wherein consists that
appearing (of the soul) in its own form?</p>
<p>To this we make the following reply.&mdash;Before the rise of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id=
"page187"></a>{187}</span> discriminative knowledge the nature of
the individual soul, which is (in reality) pure light, is
non-discriminated as it were from its limiting adjuncts consisting
of body, senses, mind, sense-objects and feelings, and appears as
consisting of the energies of seeing and so on. Similarly&mdash;to
quote an analogous case from ordinary experience&mdash;the true
nature of a pure crystal, i.e. its transparency and whiteness, is,
before the rise of discriminative knowledge (on the part of the
observer), non-discriminated as it were from any limiting adjuncts
of red or blue colour; while, as soon as through some means of true
cognition discriminative knowledge has arisen, it is said to have
now accomplished its true nature, i.e. transparency and whiteness,
although in reality it had already done so before. Thus the
discriminative knowledge, effected by <i>S</i>ruti, on the part of
the individual soul which previously is non-discriminated as it
were from its limiting adjuncts, is (according to the scriptural
passage under discussion) the soul's rising from the body, and the
fruit of that discriminative knowledge is its accomplishment in its
true nature, i.e. the comprehension that its nature is the pure
Self. Thus the embodiedness and the non-embodiedness of the Self
are due merely to discrimination and non-discrimination, in
agreement with the mantra, 'Bodiless within the bodies,' &amp;c.
(Ka. Up. I, 2, 22), and the statement of Sm<i>ri</i>ti as to the
non-difference between embodiedness and non-embodiedness 'Though
dwelling in the body, O Kaunteya, it does not act and is not
tainted' (Bha. G&icirc;. XIII, 31). The individual soul is
therefore called 'That whose true nature is non-manifest' merely on
account of the absence of discriminative knowledge, and it is
called 'That whose nature has become manifest' on account of the
presence of such knowledge. Manifestation and non-manifestation of
its nature of a different kind are not possible, since its nature
is nothing but its nature (i.e. in reality is always the same).
Thus the difference between the individual soul and the highest
Lord is owing to wrong knowledge only, not to any reality, since,
like ether, the highest Self is not in real contact with
anything.</p>
<p>And wherefrom is all this to be known?&mdash;From the
instruction <span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id=
"page188"></a>{188}</span> given by Praj&acirc;pati who, after
having referred to the j&icirc;va ('the person that is seen in the
eye,' &amp;c.), continues 'This is the immortal, the fearless, this
is Brahman.' If the well-known seer within the eye were different
from Brahman which is characterised as the immortal and fearless,
it would not be co-ordinated (as it actually is) with the immortal,
the fearless, and Brahman. The reflected Self, on the other hand,
is not spoken of as he who is characterised by the eye (the seer
within the eye), for that would render Praj&acirc;pati obnoxious to
the reproach of saying deceitful things.&mdash;So also, in the
second section, the passage, 'He who moves about happy in dreams,'
&amp;c. does not refer to a being different from the seeing person
within the eye spoken of in the first chapter, (but treats of the
same topic) as appears from the introductory clause, 'I shall
explain him further to you.' Moreover<a id="footnotetag187" name=
"footnotetag187"></a><a href="#footnote187"><sup>187</sup></a>, a
person who is conscious of having seen an elephant in a dream and
of no longer seeing it when awake discards in the waking state the
object which he had seen (in his sleep), but recognises himself
when awake to be the same person who saw something in the
dream.&mdash;Thus in the third section also Praj&acirc;pati does
indeed declare the absence of all particular cognition in the state
of deep sleep, but does not contest the identity of the cognising
Self ('In that way he does not know himself that he is I, nor all
these beings'). The following clause also, 'He is gone to utter
annihilation,' is meant to intimate only the annihilation of all
specific cognition, not the annihilation of the cogniser. For there
is no destruction of the knowing of the knower as&mdash;according
to another scriptural passage (B<i>ri</i>. Up. IV, 3,
30)&mdash;that is imperishable.&mdash;Thus, again, in the fourth
section the introductory phrase of Praj&acirc;pati is, 'I shall
explain him further to you and nothing different from this;' he
thereupon refutes the connexion (of the Self) with the body and
other limiting conditions ('Maghavat, this body is mortal,'
&amp;c.), shows the individual soul&mdash;which is there called
'the serene being'&mdash;in <span class="pagenum"><a name="page189"
id="page189"></a>{189}</span> the state when it has reached the
nature of Brahman ('It appears in its own form'), and thus proves
the soul to be non-different from the highest Brahman whose
characteristics are immortality and fearlessness.</p>
<p>Some (teachers) however are of opinion that if the highest Self
is meant (in the fourth section) it would be inappropriate to
understand the words 'This (him) I will explain further,' &amp;c.,
as referring to the individual soul, and therefore suppose that the
reference is (not to the individual soul forming the topic of the
three preceding sections, but) to the Self possessing the qualities
of freeness from sin, &amp;c., which Self is pointed out at the
beginning of the entire chapter (VII, 1).&mdash;Against this
interpretation we remark that, in the first place, it disregards
the direct enunciation of the pronoun (i.e. the 'this' in 'this I
will explain') which rests on something approximate (i.e. refers to
something mentioned not far off), and, in the second place, is
opposed to the word 'further' (or 'again') met with in the text,
since from that interpretation it would follow that what had been
discussed in the preceding sections is not again discussed in the
subsequent section. Moreover, if Praj&acirc;pati, after having made
a promise in the clause, 'This I shall explain' (where that clause
occurs for the first time), did previously to the fourth section
explain a different topic in each section, we should have to
conclude that he acted deceitfully.&mdash;Hence (our opinion about
the purport of the whole chapter remains valid, viz. that it sets
forth how) the unreal aspect of the individual soul as
such&mdash;which is a mere presentation of Nescience, is stained by
all the desires and aversions attached to agents and enjoyers, and
is connected with evils of various kinds&mdash;is dissolved by true
knowledge, and how the soul is thus led over into the opposite
state, i.e. into its true state in which it is one with the highest
Lord and distinguished by freedom from sin and similar attributes.
The whole process is similar to that by which an imagined snake
passes over into a rope as soon as the mind of the beholder has
freed itself from its erroneous imagination.</p>
<p>Others again, and among them some of ours
(asmad&icirc;y&acirc;<i>s</i> <i>k</i>a. ke<i>k</i>it), are of
opinion that the individual soul as such <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>{190}</span> is real.
To the end of refuting all these speculators who obstruct the way
to the complete intuition of the unity of the Self this
<i>s</i>&acirc;r&icirc;raka-<i>s</i>&acirc;stra has been set forth,
whose aim it is to show that there is only one highest Lord ever
unchanging, whose substance is cognition<a id="footnotetag188"
name="footnotetag188"></a><a href=
"#footnote188"><sup>188</sup></a>, and who, by means of Nescience,
manifests himself in various ways, just as a thaumaturg appears in
different shapes by means of his magical power. Besides that Lord
there is no other substance of cognition.&mdash;If, now, the
S&ucirc;trak&acirc;ra raises and refutes the doubt whether a
certain passage which (in reality) refers to the Lord does refer to
the individual soul, as he does in this and the preceding
S&ucirc;tras<a id="footnotetag189" name=
"footnotetag189"></a><a href="#footnote189"><sup>189</sup></a>, he
does so for the following purpose. To the highest Self which is
eternally pure, intelligent and free, which is never changing, one
only, not in contact with anything, devoid of form, the opposite
characteristics of the individual soul are erroneously ascribed;
just as ignorant men ascribe blue colour to the colourless ether.
In order to remove this erroneous opinion by means of Vedic
passages tending either to prove the unity of the Self or to
disprove the doctrine of duality&mdash;which passages he
strengthens by arguments&mdash;he insists on the difference of the
highest Self from the individual soul, does however not mean to
prove thereby that the soul is different from the highest Self,
but, whenever speaking of the soul, refers to its distinction (from
the Self) as forming an item of ordinary thought, due to the power
of Nescience. For thus, he thinks, the Vedic injunctions of works
which are given with a view to the states of acting and enjoying,
natural (to the non-enlightened soul), are not
stultified.&mdash;That, however, the absolute unity of the Self is
the real purport of the <i>s</i>&acirc;stra's teaching, the
S&ucirc;trak&acirc;ra declares, for instance, in I, 1, 30<a id=
"footnotetag190" name="footnotetag190"></a><a href=
"#footnote190"><sup>190</sup></a>. The refutation of the reproach
of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id=
"page191"></a>{191}</span> futility raised against the injunctions
of works has already been set forth by us, on the ground of the
distinction between such persons as possess full knowledge, and
such as do not.</p>
<p>20. And the reference (to the individual soul) has a different
meaning.</p>
<p>The alleged reference to the individual soul which has been
pointed out (by the p&ucirc;rvapakshin) in the passage
complementary to the passage about the small ether ('Now that
serene being,' &amp;c., VIII, 3, 4) teaches, if the small ether is
interpreted to mean the highest Lord, neither the worship of the
individual soul nor any qualification of the subject under
discussion (viz. the small ether), and is therefore devoid of
meaning.&mdash;On that account the S&ucirc;tra declares that the
reference has another meaning, i.e. that the reference to the
individual soul is not meant to determine the nature of the
individual soul, but rather the nature of the highest Lord. In the
following manner. The individual soul which, in the passage
referred to, is called the serene being, acts in the waking state
as the ruler of the aggregate comprising the body and the
sense-organs; permeates in sleep the na<i>d</i>&icirc;s of the
body, and enjoys the dream visions resulting from the impressions
of the waking state; and, finally, desirous of reaching an inner
refuge, rises in the state of deep sleep beyond its imagined
connexion with the gross and the subtle body, reaches the highest
light, i.e. the highest Brahman previously called ether, and thus
divesting itself of the state of specific cognition appears in its
own (true) nature. The highest light which the soul is to reach and
through which it is manifested in its true nature is the Self, free
from sin and so on, which is there represented as the object of
worship.&mdash;In this sense the reference to the individual soul
can be admitted by those also who maintain that in reality the
highest Lord is meant.</p>
<p>21. If it be said that on account of the scriptural <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192"></a>{192}</span>
declaration of the smallness (of the ether) (the Lord cannot be
meant; we reply that) that has been explained (before).</p>
<p>The p&ucirc;rvapakshin has remarked that the smallness of the
ether stated by Scripture ('In it is that small ether') does not
agree with the highest Lord, that it may however be predicated of
the individual soul which (in another passage) is compared to the
point of a goad. As that remark calls for a refutation we point out
that it has been refuted already, it having been shown&mdash;under
I, 2, 7&mdash;that a relative smallness may be attributed to the
Lord. The same refutation is&mdash;as the S&ucirc;tra points
out&mdash;to be applied here also.&mdash;That smallness is,
moreover, contradicted by that scriptural passage which compares
(the ether within the heart) with the known (universal) ether. ('As
large as is this ether so large is the ether within the
heart.')</p>
<p>22. On account of the acting after (i.e. the shining after),
(that after which sun, moon, &amp;c. are said to shine is the
highest Self), and (because by the light) of him (all this is said
to be lighted).</p>
<p>We read (Mu. Up. II, 2, 10, and Ka. Up. V, 15), 'The sun does
not shine there, nor the moon and the stars, nor these lightnings,
much less this fire. After him when he shines everything shines; by
the light of him all this is lighted.' The question here arises
whether he 'after whom when he shines everything shines, and by
whose light all this is lighted,' is some luminous substance, or
the highest Self (pr&acirc;j<i>&ntilde;</i>a &acirc;tman).</p>
<p>A luminous substance, the p&ucirc;rvapakshin
maintains.&mdash;Why?&mdash;Because the passage denies the shining
only of such luminous bodies as the sun and the like. It is known
(from every-day experience) that luminous bodies such as the moon
and the stars do not shine at daytime when the sun, which is itself
a luminous body, is shining. Hence we infer that that thing on
account of which all this, including the moon, the stars, and the
sun himself, does not <span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id=
"page193"></a>{193}</span> shine is likewise a thing of light. The
'shining after' also is possible only if there is a luminous body
already, for we know from experience that 'acting after'
(imitation) of any kind takes place only when there are more than
one agent of similar nature; one man, for instance, walks after
another man who walks himself. Therefore we consider it settled
that the passage refers to some luminous body.</p>
<p>To this we reply that the highest Self only can be
meant.&mdash;Why?&mdash;On account of the acting after. The shining
after mentioned in the passage, 'After him when he shines
everything shines,' is possible only if the
pr&acirc;j<i>&ntilde;</i>a Self, i.e. the highest Self, is
understood. Of that pr&acirc;j<i>&ntilde;</i>a Self another
scriptural passage says, 'His form is light, his thoughts are true'
(Ch. Up. III, 14, 2). On the other hand, it is not by any means
known that the sun, &amp;c. shines after some other luminous body.
Moreover, on account of the equality of nature of all luminous
bodies such as the sun and the like, there is no need for them of
any other luminous body after which they should shine; for we see
that a lamp, for instance, does not 'shine after' another lamp. Nor
is there any such absolute rule (as the p&ucirc;rvapakshin
asserted) that acting after is observed only among things of
similar nature. It is rather observed among things of dissimilar
nature also; for a red-hot iron ball acts after, i.e. burns after
the burning fire, and the dust of the ground blows (is blown) after
the blowing wind.&mdash;The clause 'on account of the acting after'
(which forms part of the S&ucirc;tra) points to the shining after
(mentioned in the scriptural <i>s</i>loka under discussion); the
clause 'and of him' points to the fourth p&acirc;da of the same
<i>s</i>loka. The meaning of this latter clause is that the cause
assigned for the light of the sun, &amp;c. (in the passage 'by the
light of him everything is lighted') intimates the
pr&acirc;j<i>&ntilde;</i>a Self. For of that Self Scripture says,
'Him the gods worship as the light of lights, as immortal time'
(B<i>ri</i>. Up. IV, 4, 16). That, on the other hand, the light of
the sun, the moon, &amp;c, should shine by some other (physical)
light is, in the first place, not known; and, in the second place,
absurd <span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id=
"page194"></a>{194}</span> as one (physical) light is counteracted
by another.&mdash;Or else the cause assigned for the shining does
not apply only to the sun and the other bodies mentioned in the
<i>s</i>loka; but the meaning (of the last p&acirc;da) rather
is&mdash;as we may conclude from the comprehensive statement 'all
this'&mdash;that the manifestation of this entire world consisting
of names and forms, acts, agents and fruits (of action) has for its
cause the existence of the light of Brahman; just as the existence
of the light of the sun is the cause of the manifestation of all
form and colour.&mdash;Moreover, the text shows by means of the
word 'there' ('the sun does not shine there,' &amp;c.) that the
passage is to be connected with the general topic, and that topic
is Brahman as appears from Mu. Up. II, 2, 5, 'In whom the heaven,
the earth, and the sky are woven,' &amp;c. The same appears from a
passage subsequent (on the one just quoted and immediately
preceding the passage under discussion). 'In the highest golden
sheath there is the Brahman without passion and without parts; that
is pure, that is the light of lights, that is it which they know
who know the Self.' This passage giving rise to the question, 'How
is it the light of lights?' there is occasion for the reply given
in 'The sun does not shine there,' &amp;c.&mdash;In refutation of
the assertion that the shining of luminous bodies such as the sun
and the moon can be denied only in case of there being another
luminous body&mdash;as, for instance, the light of the moon and the
stars is denied only when the sun is shining&mdash;we point out
that it has been shown that he (the Self) only can be the luminous
being referred to, nothing else. And it is quite possible to deny
the shining of sun, moon, and so on with regard to Brahman; for
whatever is perceived is perceived by the light of Brahman only so
that sun, moon, &amp;c. can be said to shine in it; while Brahman
as self-luminous is not perceived by means of any other light.
Brahman manifests everything else, but is not manifested by
anything else; according to such scriptural passages as, 'By the
Self alone as his light man sits,' &amp;c. (B<i>ri</i>. Up. IV, 3,
6), and 'He is incomprehensible, for he cannot be comprehended
'(B<i>ri</i>. Up. IV, 2, 4).</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id=
"page195"></a>{195}</span>
<p>23. Moreover Sm<i>ri</i>ti also speaks of him (i.e. of the
pr&acirc;j<i>&ntilde;</i>a Self as being the universal light).</p>
<p>Moreover that aspect of the pr&acirc;j<i>&ntilde;</i>a Self is
spoken of in Sm<i>ri</i>ti also, viz. in the Bhagavad
G&icirc;t&acirc; (XV, 6, 12), 'Neither the sun, nor the moon, nor
the fire illumines that; having gone into which men do not return,
that is my highest seat.' And 'The light which abiding in the sun
illumines the whole world, and that which is in the moon and that
which is in the fire, all that light know to be mine.'</p>
<p>24. On account of the term, (viz. the term 'lord' applied to it)
the (person) measured (by a thumb) (is the highest Lord).</p>
<p>We read (Ka. Up. II, 4, 12), 'The person of the size of a thumb
stands in the middle of the Self,' &amp;c., and (II, 4, 13), 'That
person, of the size of a thumb, is like a light without smoke, lord
of the past and of the future, he is the same to-day and to-morrow.
This is that.'&mdash;The question here arises whether the person of
the size of a thumb mentioned in the text is the cognitional
(individual) Self or the highest Self.</p>
<p>The p&ucirc;rvapakshin maintains that on account of the
declaration of the person's size the cognitional Self is meant. For
to the highest Self which is of infinite length and breadth
Scripture would not ascribe the measure of a span; of the
cognitional Self, on the other hand, which is connected with
limiting adjuncts, extension of the size of a span may, by means of
some fictitious assumption, be predicated. Sm<i>ri</i>ti also
confirms this, 'Then Yama drew forth, by force, from the body of
Satyavat the person of the size of a thumb tied to Yama's noose and
helpless' (Mah&acirc;bh. III, 16763). For as Yama could not pull
out by force the highest Self, the passage is clearly seen to refer
to the transmigrating (individual soul) of the size of a thumb, and
we thence infer that the same Self is meant in the Vedic passage
under discussion.</p>
<p>To this we reply that the person a thumb long can only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id=
"page196"></a>{196}</span> be the highest Lord.&mdash;Why?&mdash;On
account of the term 'lord of the past and of the future.' For none
but the highest Lord is the absolute ruler of the past and the
future.&mdash;Moreover, the clause 'this is that' connects the
passage with that which had been enquired about, and therefore
forms the topic of discussion. And what had been enquired about is
Brahman, 'That which thou seest as neither this nor that, as
neither effect nor cause, as neither past nor future, tell me that'
(I, 2, 14).&mdash;'On account of the term,' i.e. on account of the
direct statement, in the text, of a designation, viz. the term
'Lord,' we understand that the highest Lord is meant<a id=
"footnotetag191" name="footnotetag191"></a><a href=
"#footnote191"><sup>191</sup></a>.&mdash;But still the question
remains how a certain extension can be attributed to the
omnipresent highest Self.&mdash;The reply to this is given, in the
next S&ucirc;tra.</p>
<p>25. But with reference to the heart (the highest Self is said to
be of the size of a span), as men are entitled (to the study of the
Veda).</p>
<p>The measure of a span is ascribed to the highest Lord, although
omnipresent with reference to his abiding within the heart; just as
to ether (space) the measure of a cubit is ascribed with reference
to the joint of a bamboo. For, on the one hand, the measure of a
span cannot be ascribed directly to the highest Self which exceeds
all measure, and, on the other hand, it has been shown that none
but the highest Lord can be meant here, on account of the term
'Lord,' and so on.&mdash;But&mdash;an objection may be
raised&mdash;as the size of the heart varies in the different
classes of living beings it cannot be maintained that the
declaration <span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id=
"page197"></a>{197}</span> of the highest Self being of the size of
a thumb can be explained with reference to the heart.&mdash;To this
objection the second half of the S&ucirc;tra replies: On account of
men (only) being entitled. For the <i>s</i>&acirc;stra, although
propounded without distinction (i.e. although not itself specifying
what class of beings is to proceed according to its precepts), does
in reality entitle men<a id="footnotetag192" name=
"footnotetag192"></a><a href="#footnote192"><sup>192</sup></a> only
(to act according to its precepts); for men only (of the three
higher castes) are, firstly, capable (of complying with the
precepts of the <i>s</i>&acirc;stra); are, secondly, desirous (of
the results of actions enjoined by the <i>s</i>&acirc;stra); are,
thirdly, not excluded by prohibitions; and are, fourthly, subject
to the precepts about the upanayana ceremony and so on<a id=
"footnotetag193" name="footnotetag193"></a><a href=
"#footnote193"><sup>193</sup></a>. This point has been explained in
the section treating of the definition of adhik&acirc;ra
(P&ucirc;rva M&icirc;m. S. VI, 1).&mdash;Now the human body has
ordinarily a fixed size, and hence the heart also has a fixed size,
viz. the size of a thumb. Hence, as men (only) are entitled to
study and practise the <i>s</i>&acirc;stra, the highest Self may,
with reference to its dwelling in the human heart, be spoken of as
being of the size of a thumb.&mdash;In reply to the
p&ucirc;rvapakshin's reasoning that on account of the statement of
size and on account of Sm<i>ri</i>ti we can understand by him who
is of the size of a thumb the transmigrating soul only, we remark
that&mdash;analogously to such passages as 'That is the Self,'
'That art thou'&mdash;our passage <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page198" id="page198"></a>{198}</span> teaches that the
transmigrating soul which is of the size of a thumb is (in reality)
Brahman. For the Ved&acirc;nta-passages have a twofold purport;
some of them aim at setting forth the nature of the highest Self,
some at teaching the unity of the individual soul with the highest
Self. Our passage teaches the unity of the individual soul with the
highest Self, not the size of anything. This point is made clear
further on in the Upanishad, 'The person of the size of a thumb,
the inner Self, is always settled in the heart of men. Let a man
draw that Self forth from his body with steadiness, as one draws
the pith from a reed. Let him know that Self as the Bright, as the
Immortal' (II, 6, 17).</p>
<p>26. Also (beings) above them, (viz. men) (are qualified for the
study and practice of the Veda), on account of the possibility (of
it), according to B&acirc;dar&acirc;ya<i>n</i>a.</p>
<p>It has been said above that the passage about him who is of the
size of a thumb has reference to the human heart, because men are
entitled to study and act according to the <i>s</i>&acirc;stra.
This gives us an occasion for the following discussion.&mdash;It is
true that the <i>s</i>&acirc;stra entitles men, but, at the same
time, there is no exclusive rule entitling men only to the
knowledge of Brahman; the teacher, B&acirc;dar&acirc;ya<i>n</i>a,
rather thinks that the <i>s</i>&acirc;stra entitles those (classes
of beings) also which are above men, viz. gods, and so on.&mdash;On
what account?&mdash;On the account of possibility.&mdash;For in
their cases also the different causes on which the qualification
depends, such as having certain desires, and so on, may exist. In
the first place, the gods also may have the desire of final
release, caused by the reflection that all effects, objects, and
powers are non-permanent. In the second place, they may be capable
of it as their corporeality appears from mantras, arthav&acirc;das,
itih&acirc;sas, pur&acirc;<i>n</i>as, and ordinary experience. In
the third place, there is no prohibition (excluding them like
<i>S</i>&ucirc;dras). Nor does, in the fourth place, the scriptural
rule about the upanayana-ceremony annul their title; for that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id=
"page199"></a>{199}</span> ceremony merely subserves the study of
the Veda, and to the gods the Veda is manifest of itself (without
study). That the gods, moreover, for the purpose of acquiring
knowledge, undergo discipleship, and the like, appears from such
scriptural passages as 'One hundred and one years Indra lived as a
disciple with Praj&acirc;pati' (Ch. Up. VIII, 11, 3), and
'Bh<i>ri</i>gu V&acirc;ru<i>n</i>i went to his father
Varu<i>n</i>a, saying, "Sir, teach me Brahman"' (Taitt. Up. III,
1).&mdash;And the reasons which have been given above against gods
and <i>ri</i>shis being entitled to perform religious works (such
as sacrifices), viz. the circumstance of there being no other gods
(to whom the gods could offer sacrifices), and of there being no
other <i>ri</i>shis (who could be invoked during the sacrifice), do
not apply to the case of branches of knowledge. For Indra and the
other gods, when applying themselves to knowledge, have no acts to
perform with a view to Indra, and so on; nor have Bh<i>ri</i>gu and
other <i>ri</i>shis, in the same case, to do anything with the
circumstance of their belonging to the same gotra as Bh<i>ri</i>gu,
&amp;c. What, then, should stand in the way of the gods' and
<i>ri</i>shis' right to acquire knowledge?&mdash;Moreover, the
passage about that which is of the size of a thumb remains equally
valid, if the right of the gods, &amp;c. is admitted; it has then
only to be explained in each particular case by a reference to the
particular size of the thumb (of the class of beings spoken
of).</p>
<p>27. If it be said that (the corporeal individuality of the gods
involves) a contradiction to (sacrificial) works; we deny that, on
account of the observation of the assumption (on the part of the
gods) of several (forms).</p>
<p>If the right of the gods, and other beings superior to men, to
the acquisition of knowledge is founded on the assumption of their
corporeality, &amp;c., we shall have to admit, in consequence of
that corporeality, that Indra and the other gods stand in the
relation of subordinate members (a@nga) to sacrificial acts, by
means of their being present in person <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200"></a>{200}</span> just as
the priests are. But this admission will lead to 'a contradiction
in the sacrificial acts,' because the circumstance of the gods
forming the members of sacrificial acts by means of their personal
presence, is neither actually observed nor possible. For it is not
possible that one and the same Indra should, at the same time, be
present in person at many sacrifices.</p>
<p>To this we reply, that there is no such
contradiction.&mdash;Why?&mdash;On account of the assumption of
several (forms). For it is possible for one and the same divine
Self to assume several forms at the same time.&mdash;How is that
known?&mdash;From observation.&mdash;For a scriptural passage at
first replies to the question how many gods there are, by the
declaration that there are 'Three and three hundred, three and
three thousand,' and subsequently, on the question who they are,
declares 'They (the 303 and 3003) are only the various powers of
them, in reality there are only thirty-three gods' (B<i>ri</i>. Up.
III, 9, 1, 2); showing thereby that one and the same divine Self
may at the same time appear in many forms. After that it proceeds
to show that these thirty-three gods themselves are in reality
contained in six, five, &amp;c., and, finally, by replying to the
question, 'Who is the one god?' that Breath is the one god, shows
that the gods are all forms of Breath, and that Breath, therefore,
can at the same time appear in many forms.&mdash;Sm<i>ri</i>ti also
has a similar statement, 'A Yogin, O hero of the Bharatas, may, by
his power, multiply his Self in many thousand shapes, and in them
walk about on the earth. In some he may enjoy the objects, in
others he may undergo dire penance, and, finally, he may again
retract them all, just as the sun retracts the multitude of his
rays.' If such Sm<i>ri</i>ti passages as the above declare that
even Yogins, who have merely acquired various extraordinary powers,
such as subtlety of body, and the like, may animate several bodies
at the same time, how much more capable of such feats must the gods
be, who naturally possess all supernatural powers. The gods thus
being able to assume several shapes, a god may divide himself into
many forms and enter into relation with many sacrifices at the same
time, remaining all the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id=
"page201"></a>{201}</span> while unseen by others, in consequence
of his power to render himself invisible.</p>
<p>The latter part of the S&ucirc;tra may be explained in a
different manner also, viz. as meaning that even beings enjoying
corporeal individuality are seen to enter into mere subordinate
relation to more than one action. Sometimes, indeed, one individual
does not at the same time enter into subordinate relation to
different actions; one br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a, for instance, is not
at the same time entertained by many entertainers. But in other
cases one individual stands in subordinate relation to many actions
at the same time; one br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a, for instance, may
constitute the object of the reverence done to him by many persons
at the same time. Similarly, it is possible that, as the sacrifice
consists in the parting (on the part of the sacrificer with some
offering) with a view (to some divinity), many persons may at the
same time part with their respective offerings, all of them having
in view one and the same individual divinity. The individuality of
the gods does not, therefore, involve any contradiction in
sacrificial works.</p>
<p>28. If it be said (that a contradiction will result) in respect
of the word; we refute this objection on the ground that (the
world) originates from the word, as is shown by perception and
inference.</p>
<p>Let it then be granted that, from the admission of the corporeal
individuality of the gods, no contradiction will result in the case
of sacrificial works. Still a contradiction will result in respect
of the 'word' (<i>s</i>abda).&mdash;How?&mdash;The
authoritativeness of the Veda has been proved 'from its
independence,' basing on the original (eternal) connection of the
word with its sense ('the thing signified')<a id="footnotetag194"
name="footnotetag194"></a><a href=
"#footnote194"><sup>194</sup></a>. But now, although a divinity
possessing corporeal individuality, such as admitted above, may, by
means of its supernatural powers, be able to enjoy at the same time
the oblations <span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id=
"page202"></a>{202}</span> which form part of several sacrifices
yet it will, on account of its very individuality, be subject to
birth and death just as we men are, and hence, the eternal
connexion of the eternal word with a non-eternal thing being
destroyed, a contradiction will arise with regard to the
authoritativeness proved to belong to the word of the Veda.</p>
<p>To this we reply that no such contradiction
exists.&mdash;Why?&mdash;'On account of their origin from it.' For
from that very same word of the Veda the world, with the gods and
other beings, originates.&mdash;But&mdash;an objection will be
raised&mdash;in S&ucirc;tra I, 1, 2 ('That whence there is the
origin, &amp;c. of this world') it has been proved that the world
originates from Brahman; how then can it be said here that it
originates from the word? And, moreover, even if the origin of the
world from the word of the Veda be admitted, how is the
contradiction in regard to the word removed thereby, inasmuch as
the Vasus, the Rudras, the &Acirc;dityas, the Vi<i>s</i>vedevas,
and the Maruts<a id="footnotetag195" name=
"footnotetag195"></a><a href="#footnote195"><sup>195</sup></a> are
non-eternal beings, because produced; and if they are non-eternal,
what is there to preclude the non-eternality of the Vedic words
Vasu, &amp;c. designating them? For it is known from every-day life
that only when the son of Devadatta is born, the name
Yaj<i>&ntilde;</i>adatta is given to him (lit. made for him)<a id=
"footnotetag196" name="footnotetag196"></a><a href=
"#footnote196"><sup>196</sup></a>. Hence we adhere to our opinion
that a contradiction does arise with regard to the 'word.'</p>
<p>This objection we negative, on the ground that we observe the
eternity of the connexion between such words as cow, and so on, and
the things denoted by them. For, although the individuals of the
(species denoted by the word) cow have an origin, their
species<a id="footnotetag197" name="footnotetag197"></a><a href=
"#footnote197"><sup>197</sup></a> does not have an origin, since of
(the three categories) substances, qualities, and actions the
individuals only originate, not the species. Now it is with the
species that the words are connected, not with the individuals,
which, as being infinite in number, are not capable of entering
into that connexion. Hence, although <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page203" id="page203"></a>{203}</span> the individuals do not
originate, no contradiction arises in the case of words such as
cow, and the like, since the species are eternal. Similarly,
although individual gods are admitted to originate, there arises no
contradiction in the case of such words as Vasu, and the like,
since the species denoted by them are eternal. And that the gods,
and so on, belong to different species, is to be concluded from the
descriptions of their various personal appearance, such as given in
the mantras, arthav&acirc;das, &amp;c. Terms such as 'Indra' rest
on the connexion (of some particular being) with some particular
place, analogously to terms such as 'army-leader;' hence, whoever
occupies that particular place is called by that particular
name.&mdash;The origination of the world from the 'word' is not to
be understood in that sense, that the word constitutes the material
cause of the world, as Brahman does; but while there exist the
everlasting words, whose essence is the power of denotation in
connexion with their eternal sense (i.e. the &acirc;k<i>r</i>itis
denoted), the accomplishment of such individual things as are
capable of having those words applied to them is called an
origination from those words.</p>
<p>How then is it known that the world originates from the
word?&mdash;'From perception and inference.' Perception here
denotes Scripture which, in order to be authoritative, is
independent (of anything else). 'Inference' denotes Sm<i>r</i>iti
which, in order to be authoritative, depends on something else
(viz. Scripture). These two declare that creation is preceded by
the word. Thus a scriptural passage says, 'At the word these
Praj&acirc;pati created the gods; at the words were poured out he
created men; at the word drops he created the fathers; at the words
through the filter he created the Soma cups; at the words the swift
ones he created the stotra; at the words to all he created the
<i>s</i>astra; at the word blessings he created the other beings.'
And another passage says, 'He with his mind united himself with
speech (i.e. the word of the Veda.&mdash;B<i>ri</i>. Up. I, 2, 4).
Thus Scripture declares in different places that the word precedes
the creation.&mdash;Sm<i>r</i>ti also delivers itself as follows,
'In the beginning <span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id=
"page204"></a>{204}</span> a divine voice, eternal, without
beginning or end, formed of the Vedas was uttered by
Svayambh&ucirc;, from which all activities proceeded.' By the
'uttering' of the voice we have here to understand the starting of
the oral tradition (of the Veda), because of a voice without
beginning or end 'uttering' in any other sense cannot be
predicated.&mdash;Again, we read, 'In the beginning
Mahe<i>s</i>vara shaped from the words of the Veda the names and
forms of all beings and the procedure of all actions.' And again,
'The several names, actions, and conditions of all things he shaped
in the beginning from the words of the Veda' (Manu I, 21).
Moreover, we all know from observation that any one when setting
about some thing which he wishes to accomplish first remembers the
word denoting the thing, and after that sets to work. We therefore
conclude that before the creation the Vedic words became manifest
in the mind of Praj&acirc;pati the creator, and that after that he
created the things conesponding to those words. Scripture also,
where it says (Taitt. Br&acirc;. II, 2, 4, 2) 'uttering bh&ucirc;r
he created the earth,' &amp;c., shows that the worlds such as the
earth, &amp;c. became manifest, i.e. were created from the words
bh&ucirc;r, &amp;c. which had become manifest in the mind (of
Praj&acirc;pati).</p>
<p>Of what nature then is the 'word' with a view to which it is
said that the world originates from the 'word?'&mdash;It is the
spho<i>t</i>a, the p&ucirc;rvapakshin says.<a id="footnotetag198"
name="footnotetag198"></a><a href="#footnote198"><sup>198</sup></a>
For on the assumption <span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id=
"page205"></a>{205}</span> that the letters are the word, the
doctrine that the individual gods, and so on, originates from the
eternal words of the Veda could not in any way be proved, since the
letters perish as soon as they are produced (i.e. pronounced).
These perishable letters are moreover apprehended as differing
according to the pronunciation of the individual speaker. For this
reason we are able to determine, merely from the sound of the voice
of some unseen person whom we hear reading, who is reading, whether
Devadatta or Yaj<i>&ntilde;</i>adatta or some other man. And it
cannot be maintained that this apprehension of difference regarding
the letters is an erroneous one; for we do not apprehend anything
else whereby it is refuted. Nor is it reasonable to maintain that
the apprehension of the sense of a word results from the letters.
For it can neither be maintained that each letter by itself
intimates the sense, since that would be too wide an
assumption;<a id="footnotetag199" name=
"footnotetag199"></a><a href="#footnote199"><sup>199</sup></a> nor
that there takes place a simultaneous apprehension of the whole
aggregate of letters; since the letters succeed one another in
time. Nor can we admit the explanation that the last letter of the
word together with the impressions produced by the perception of
the preceding letters is that which makes us apprehend the sense.
For the word makes us apprehend the sense only if it is itself
apprehended in so far as having reference to the mental grasp of
the constant connexion (of the word and the sense), just as smoke
makes us infer the existence of fire only when it is itself
apprehended; but an apprehension of the last letter combined with
the impressions produced by the preceding letters does not actually
take place, because those impressions are not objects of
perception.<a id="footnotetag200" name=
"footnotetag200"></a><a href="#footnote200"><sup>200</sup></a> Nor,
again, can it be maintained that (although those impressions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id=
"page206"></a>{206}</span> are not objects of perception, yet they
may be inferred from their effects, and that thus) the actual
perception of the last letter combined with the impressions left by
the preceding letters&mdash;which impressions are apprehended from
their effects&mdash;is that which intimates the sense of the word;
for that effect of the impressions, viz. the remembrance of the
entire word, is itself something consisting of parts which succeed
each other in time.&mdash;From all this it follows that the
spho<i>t</i>a is the word. After the apprehending agent, i.e. the
buddhi, has, through the apprehension of the several letters of the
word, received rudimentary impressions, and after those impressions
have been matured through the apprehension of the last letter, the
spho<i>t</i>a presents itself in the buddhi all at once as the
object of one mental act of apprehension.&mdash;And it must not be
maintained that that one act of apprehension is merely an act of
remembrance having for its object the letters of the word; for the
letters which are more than one cannot form the object of one act
of apprehension.&mdash;As that spho<i>t</i>a is recognised as the
same as often as the word is pronounced, it is eternal; while the
apprehension of difference referred to above has for its object the
letters merely. From this eternal word, which is of the nature of
the spho<i>t</i>a and possesses denotative power, there is produced
the object denoted, i.e. this world which consists of actions,
agents, and results of action.</p>
<p>Against this doctrine the reverend Upavarsha maintains that the
letters only are the word.&mdash;But&mdash;an objection is
raised&mdash;it has been said above that the letters no sooner
produced pass away!&mdash;That assertion is not true, we reply; for
they are recognised as the same letters (each time they are
produced anew).&mdash;Nor can it be maintained that the recognition
is due to similarity only, as in the case of hairs, for instance;
for the fact of the recognition being a recognition in the strict
sense of the word is not contradicted by any other means of
proof.&mdash;Nor, again, can it be said <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>{207}</span> that the
recognition has its cause in the species (so that not the same
individual letter would be recognised, but only a letter belonging
to the same species as other letters heard before); for, as a
matter of fact, the same individual letters are recognised. That
the recognition of the letters rests on the species could be
maintained only if whenever the letters are pronounced different
individual letters were apprehended, just as several cows are
apprehended as different individuals belonging to the same species.
But this is actually not the case; for the (same) individual
letters are recognised as often as they are pronounced. If, for
instance, the word cow is pronounced twice, we think not that two
different words have been pronounced, but that the same individual
word has been repeated.&mdash;But, our opponent reminds us, it has
been shown above, that the letters are apprehended as different
owing to differences of pronunciation, as appears from the fact
that we apprehend a difference when merely hearing the sound of
Devadatta or Yaj<i>&ntilde;</i>adatta reading.&mdash;Although, we
reply, it is a settled matter that the letters are recognised as
the same, yet we admit that there are differences in the
apprehension of the letters; but as the letters are articulated by
means of the conjunction and disjunction (of the breath with the
palate, the teeth, &amp;c.), those differences are rightly ascribed
to the various character of the articulating agents and not to the
intrinsic nature of the letters themselves. Those, moreover, who
maintain that the individual letters are different have, in order
to account for the fact of recognition, to assume species of
letters, and further to admit that the apprehension of difference
is conditioned by external factors. Is it then not much simpler to
assume, as we do, that the apprehension of difference is
conditioned by external factors while the recognition is due to the
intrinsic nature of the letters? And this very fact of recognition
is that mental process which prevents us from looking on the
apprehension of difference as having the letters for its object (so
that the opponent was wrong in denying the existence of such a
process). For how should, for instance, the one syllable ga, when
it is pronounced in <span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id=
"page208"></a>{208}</span> the same moment by several persons, be
at the same time of different nature, viz. accented with the
ud&acirc;tta, the anud&acirc;tta, and the Svarita and nasal as well
as non-nasal<a id="footnotetag201" name=
"footnotetag201"></a><a href="#footnote201"><sup>201</sup></a>? Or
else<a id="footnotetag202" name="footnotetag202"></a><a href=
"#footnote202"><sup>202</sup></a>&mdash;and this is the preferable
explanation&mdash;we assume that the difference of apprehension is
caused not by the letters but by the tone (dhvani). By this tone we
have to understand that which enters the ear of a person who is
listening from a distance and not able to distinguish the separate
letters, and which, for a person standing near, affects the letters
with its own distinctions, such as high or low pitch and so on. It
is on this tone that all the distinctions of ud&acirc;tta,
anud&acirc;tta, and so on depend, and not on the intrinsic nature
of the letters; for they are recognised as the same whenever they
are pronounced. On this theory only we gain a basis for the
distinctive apprehension of the ud&acirc;tta, the anud&acirc;tta,
and the like. For on the theory first propounded (but now
rejected), we should have to assume that the distinctions of
ud&acirc;tta and so on are due to the processes of conjunction and
disjunction described above, since the letters themselves, which
are ever recognised as the same, are not different. But as those
processes of conjunction and disjunction are not matter of
perception, we cannot definitely ascertain in the letters any
differences based on those processes, and hence the apprehension of
the ud&acirc;tta and so on remains without a basis.&mdash;Nor
should it be urged that from the difference of the ud&acirc;tta and
so on there results also a difference of the letters recognised.
For a difference in one matter does not involve a difference in
some other matter which in itself is free from difference. Nobody,
for instance, thinks that because the individuals <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>{209}</span> are
different from each other the species also contains a difference in
itself.</p>
<p>The assumption of the spho<i>t</i>a is further gratuitous,
because the sense of the word may be apprehended from the
letters.&mdash;But&mdash;our opponent here objects&mdash;I do not
assume the existence of the spho<i>t</i>a. I, on the contrary,
actually perceive it; for after the buddhi has been impressed by
the successive apprehension of the letters of the word, the
spho<i>t</i>a all at once presents itself as the object of
cognition.&mdash;You are mistaken, we reply. The object of the
cognitional act of which you speak is simply the letters of the
word. That one comprehensive cognition which follows upon the
apprehension of the successive letters of the word has for its
object the entire aggregate of the letters constituting the word,
and not anything else. We conclude this from the circumstance that
in that final comprehensive cognition there are included those
letters only of which a definite given word consists, and not any
other letters. If that cognitional act had for its object the
spho<i>t</i>a&mdash;i.e. something different from the letters of
the given word&mdash;then those letters would be excluded from it
just as much as the letters of any other word. But as this is not
the case, it follows that that final comprehensive act of cognition
is nothing but an act of remembrance which has the letters of the
word for its object.&mdash;Our opponent has asserted above that the
letters of a word being several cannot form the object of one
mental act. But there he is wrong again. The ideas which we have of
a row, for instance, or a wood or an army, or of the numbers ten,
hundred, thousand, and so on, show that also such things as
comprise several unities can become the objects of one and the same
cognitional act. The idea which has for its object the word as one
whole is a derived one, in so far as it depends on the
determination of one sense in many letters<a id="footnotetag203"
name="footnotetag203"></a><a href=
"#footnote203"><sup>203</sup></a>; in the same way as the idea of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id=
"page210"></a>{210}</span> wood, an army, and so on. But&mdash;our
opponent may here object&mdash;if the word were nothing else but
the letters which in their aggregate become the object of one
mental act, such couples of words as j&acirc;r&acirc; and
r&acirc;j&acirc; or pika and kapi would not be cognised as
different words; for here the same letters are presented to
consciousness in each of the words constituting one
couple.&mdash;There is indeed, we reply, in both cases a
comprehensive consciousness of the same totality of letters; but
just as ants constitute the idea of a row only if they march one
after the other, so the letters also constitute the idea of a
certain word only if they follow each other in a certain order.
Hence it is not contrary to reason that the same letters are
cognised as different words, in consequence of the different order
in which they are arranged.</p>
<p>The hypothesis of him who maintains that the letters are the
word may therefore be finally formulated as follows. The letters of
which a word consists&mdash;assisted by a certain order and
number&mdash;have, through traditional use, entered into a
connexion with a definite sense. At the time when they are employed
they present themselves as such (i.e. in their definite order and
number) to the buddhi, which, after having apprehended the several
letters in succession, finally comprehends the entire aggregate,
and they thus unerringly intimate to the buddhi their definite
sense. This hypothesis is certainly simpler than the complicated
hypothesis of the grammarians who teach that the spho<i>t</i>a is
the word. For they have to disregard what is given by perception,
and to assume something which is never perceived; the letters
apprehended in a definite order are said to manifest the
spho<i>t</i>a, and the spho<i>t</i>a in its turn is said to
manifest the sense.</p>
<p>Or let it even be admitted that the letters are different ones
each time they are pronounced; yet, as in that case we necessarily
must assume species of letters as the basis of the recognition of
the individual letters, the function of conveying the sense which
we have demonstrated in the case of the (individual) letters has
then to be attributed to the species.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id=
"page211"></a>{211}</span>
<p>From all this it follows that the theory according to which the
individual gods and so on originate from the eternal words is
unobjectionable.</p>
<p>29. And from this very reason there follows the eternity of the
Veda.</p>
<p>As the eternity of the Veda is founded on the absence of the
remembrance of an agent only, a doubt with regard to it had been
raised owing to the doctrine that the gods and other individuals
have sprung from it. That doubt has been refuted in the preceding
S&ucirc;tra.&mdash;The present S&ucirc;tra now confirms the,
already established, eternity of the Veda. The eternity of the word
of the Veda has to be assumed for this very reason, that the world
with its definite (eternal) species, such as gods and so on,
originates from it.&mdash;A mantra also ('By means of the sacrifice
they followed the trace of speech; they found it dwelling in the
<i>ri</i>shis,' <i>Ri</i>g-veda Sa<i>m</i>h. X, 71, 3) shows that
the speech found (by the <i>ri</i>shis) was permanent.&mdash;On
this point Vedavy&acirc;sa also speaks as follows: 'Formerly the
great <i>ri</i>shis, being allowed to do so by Svayambh&ucirc;,
obtained, through their penance, the Vedas together with the
itih&acirc;sas, which had been hidden at the end of the yuga.'</p>
<p>30. And on account of the equality of names and forms there is
no contradiction (to the eternity of the word of the Veda) in the
renovation (of the world); as is seen from <i>S</i>ruti and
Sm<i>ri</i>ti.</p>
<p>If&mdash;the p&ucirc;rvapakshin resumes&mdash;the individual
gods and so on did, like the individual animals, originate and pass
away in an unbroken succession so that there would be no break of
the course of practical existence including denominations, things
denominated and agents denominating; the connexion (between word
and thing) would be eternal, and the objection as to a
contradiction with reference to the word (raised in S&ugrave;tra
27) would thereby be refuted. But if, as <i>S</i>ruti and
Sm<i>ri</i>ti declare, the whole threefold <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>{212}</span> world
periodically divests itself of name and form, and is entirely
dissolved (at the end of a kalpa), and is after that produced anew;
how can the contradiction be considered to have been removed?</p>
<p>To this we reply: 'On account of the sameness of name and
form.'&mdash;Even then the beginninglessness of the world will have
to be admitted (a point which the teacher will prove later on: II,
1, 36). And in the beginningless sa<i>m</i>s&acirc;ra we have to
look on the (relative) beginning, and the dissolution connected
with a new kalpa in the same light in which we look on the sleeping
and waking states, which, although in them according to Scripture
(a kind of) dissolution and origination take place, do not give
rise to any contradiction, since in the later waking state
(subsequent to the state of sleep) the practical existence is
carried on just as in the former one. That in the sleeping and the
waking states dissolution and origination take place is stated
Kaush. Up. III, 3, 'When a man being asleep sees no dream whatever
he becomes one with that pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a alone. Then speech goes
to him with all names, the eye with all forms, the ear with all
sounds, the mind with all thoughts. And when he awakes then, as
from a burning fire, sparks proceed in all directions, thus from
that Self the pr&acirc;<i>n</i>as proceed, each towards its place;
from the pr&acirc;<i>n</i>as the gods, from the gods the
worlds.'</p>
<p>Well, the p&ucirc;rvapakshin resumes, it may be that no
contradiction arises in the case of sleep, as during the sleep of
one person the practical existence of other persons suffers no
interruption, and as the sleeping person himself when waking from
sleep may resume the very same form of practical existence which
was his previously to his sleep. The case of a mah&acirc;pralaya
(i.e. a general annihilation of the world) is however a different
one, as then the entire current of practical existence is
interrupted, and the form of existence of a previous kalpa can be
resumed in a subsequent kalpa no more than an individual can resume
that form of existence which it enjoyed in a former birth.</p>
<p>This objection, we reply, is not valid. For although a
mah&acirc;pralaya does cut short the entire current of practical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id=
"page213"></a>{213}</span> existence, yet, by the favour of the
highest Lord, the Lords (&icirc;<i>s</i>vara), such as
Hira<i>n</i>yagarbha and so on, may continue the same form of
existence which belonged to them in the preceding kalpa. Although
ordinary animated beings do not, as we see, resume that form of
existence which belonged to them in a former birth; still we cannot
judge of the Lords as we do of ordinary beings. For as in the
series of beings which descends from man to blades of grass a
successive diminution of knowledge, power, and so on, is
observed&mdash;although they all have the common attribute of being
animated&mdash;so in the ascending series extending from man up to
Hira<i>n</i>yagarbha, a gradually increasing manifestation of
knowledge, power, &amp;c. takes place; a circumstance which
<i>S</i>ruti and Sm<i>ri</i>ti mention in many places, and which it
is impossible to deny. On that account it may very well be the case
that the Lords, such as Hira<i>n</i>yagarbha and so on, who in a
past kalpa were distinguished by superior knowledge and power of
action, and who again appear in the present kalpa, do, if favoured
by the highest Lord, continue (in the present kalpa) the same kind
of existence which they enjoyed in the preceding kalpa; just as a
man who rises from sleep continues the same form of existence which
he enjoyed previously to his sleep. Thus Scripture also declares,
'He who first creates Brahman (Hira<i>n</i>yagarbha) and delivers
the Vedas to him, to that God who is the light of his own thoughts,
I, seeking for release, go for refuge' (<i>S</i>vet. Up. VI, 18).
<i>S</i>aunaka and others moreover declare (in the
Anukrama<i>n</i>&icirc;s of the Veda) that the ten books (of the
<i>Ri</i>g-veda) were seen by Madhu<i>kkh</i>andas and other
<i>ri</i>shis.<a id="footnotetag204" name=
"footnotetag204"></a><a href="#footnote204"><sup>204</sup></a> And,
similarly, Sm<i>ri</i>ti tells us, for every Veda, of men of
exalted mental vision (<i>ri</i>shis) who 'saw' the subdivisions of
their respective Vedas, such as k&acirc;<i>nd</i>as and so on.
Scripture also declares that the performance of the sacrificial
action by means of the mantra is to be preceded by the knowledge of
the <i>ri</i>shi and so on, 'He who makes another person sacrifice
or read by means of a mantra of which he <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214"></a>{214}</span> does not
know the <i>ri</i>shi, the metre, the divinity, and the
br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a, runs against a post, falls into a pit<a id=
"footnotetag205" name="footnotetag205"></a><a href=
"#footnote205"><sup>205</sup></a>, &amp;c. &amp;c., therefore one
must know all those matters for each mantra' (&Acirc;rsheya
br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a, first section).&mdash;Moreover, religious
duty is enjoined and its opposite is forbidden, in order that the
animate beings may obtain pleasure and escape pain. Desire and
aversion have for their objects pleasure and pain, known either
from experience or from Scripture, and do not aim at anything of a
different nature. As therefore each new creation is (nothing but)
the result of the religious merit and demerit (of the animated
beings of the preceding creation), it is produced with a nature
resembling that of the preceding creation. Thus Sm<i>ri</i>ti also
declares, 'To whatever actions certain of these (animated beings)
had turned in a former creation, to the same they turn when created
again and again. Whether those actions were harmful or harmless,
gentle or cruel, right or wrong, true or untrue, influenced by them
they proceed; hence a certain person delights in actions of a
certain kind.'&mdash;Moreover, this world when being dissolved (in
a mah&acirc;pralaya) is dissolved to that extent only that the
potentiality (<i>s</i>akti) of the world remains, and (when it is
produced again) it is produced from the root of that potentiality;
otherwise we should have to admit an effect without a cause. Nor
have we the right to assume potentialities of different kind (for
the different periods of the world). Hence, although the series of
worlds from the earth upwards, and the series of different classes
of animate beings such as gods, animals, and men, and the different
conditions based on caste, &acirc;<i>s</i>rama, religious duty and
fruit (of works), although all these we say are again and again
interrupted and thereupon produced anew; we yet have to understand
that they are, in the beginningless sa<i>m</i>sara, subject to a
certain determinateness analogous to the determinateness governing
the connexion between the senses and their objects. For it is
impossible to imagine that the relation of senses and sense-objects
should be a different one in different creations, so <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215"></a>{215}</span> that, for
instance, in some new creation a sixth sense and a corresponding
sixth sense-object should manifest themselves. As, therefore, the
phenomenal world is the same in all kalpas and as the Lords are
able to continue their previous forms of existence, there manifest
themselves, in each new creation, individuals bearing the same
names and forms as the individuals of the preceding creations, and,
owing to this equality of names and forms, the admitted periodical
renovations of the world in the form of general pralayas and
general creations do not conflict with the authoritativeness of the
word of the Veda. The permanent identity of names and forms is
declared in <i>S</i>ruti as well as Sm<i>ri</i>ti; compare, for
instance, <i>Ri</i>k. Sa<i>m</i>h. X, 190, 3, 'As formerly the
creator ordered sun and moon, and the sky, and the air, and the
heavenly world;' which passage means that the highest Lord arranged
at the beginning of the present kalpa the entire world with sun and
moon, and so on, just as it had been arranged in the preceding
kalpa. Compare also Taitt. Br&acirc;hm. III, 1, 4, 1, 'Agni
desired: May I become the consumer of the food of the gods; for
that end he offered a cake on eight potsherds to Agni and the
K<i>ri</i>ttik&acirc;s.' This passage, which forms part of the
injunction of the ish<i>t</i>i to the Nakshatras, declares equality
of name and form connecting the Agni who offered and the Agni to
whom he offered.<a id="footnotetag206" name=
"footnotetag206"></a><a href="#footnote206"><sup>206</sup></a></p>
<p>Sm<i>ri</i>ti also contains similar statements to be quoted
here; so, for instance, 'Whatever were the names of the
<i>ri</i>shis and their powers to see the Vedas, the same the
Unborn one again gives to them when they are produced afresh at the
end of the night (the mah&acirc;pralaya). As the various signs of
the seasons return in succession in their due time, thus the same
beings again appear in the different yugas. And of whatever
individuality the gods of the <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page216" id="page216"></a>{216}</span> past ages were, equal to
them are the present gods in name and form.'</p>
<p>31. On account of the impossibility of (the gods being
qualified) for the madhu-vidy&acirc;, &amp;c., Jaimini (maintains)
the non-qualification (of the gods for the Brahma-vidy&acirc;).</p>
<p>A new objection is raised against the averment that the gods,
&amp;c. also are entitled to the knowledge of Brahman. The teacher,
Jaimini, considers the gods and similar beings not to have any
claim.&mdash;Why?&mdash;On account of the impossibility, in the
case of the so-called Madhu-vidy&acirc;, &amp;c. If their claim to
the knowledge of Brahman were admitted, we should have to admit
their claim to the madhu-vidy&acirc; ('the knowledge of the honey')
also, because that also is a kind of knowledge not different (from
the knowledge of Brahman). But to admit this latter claim is not
possible; for, according to the passage, 'The Sun is indeed the
honey of the devas' (Ch. Up. III, 1, 1), men are to meditate on the
sun (the god &Acirc;ditya) under the form of honey, and how, if the
gods themselves are admitted as meditating worshippers, can
&Acirc;ditya meditate upon another &Acirc;ditya?&mdash;Again, the
text, after having enumerated five kinds of nectar, the red one,
&amp;c. residing in the sun, and after having stated that the five
classes of gods, viz. the Vasus, Rudras, &Acirc;dityas, Maruts, and
S&acirc;dhyas, live on one of these nectars each, declares that 'he
who thus knows this nectar becomes one of the Vasus, with Agni at
their head, he sees the nectar and rejoices, &amp;c., and indicates
thereby that those who know the nectars enjoyed by the Vasus,
&amp;c., attain the greatness of the Vasus, &amp;c.' But how should
the Vasus themselves know other Vasus enjoying the nectar, and what
other Vasu-greatness should they desire to attain?&mdash;We have
also to compare the passages 'Agni is one foot, &Acirc;ditya is one
foot, the quarters are one foot' (Ch. Up. III, 18, 2); 'Air is
indeed the absorber' (Ch. Up. IV, 3, 1); '&Acirc;ditya is Brahman,
this is the doctrine.' All these passages treat of the meditation
on the Self of certain divinities, for which meditation these
divinities themselves <span class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id=
"page217"></a>{217}</span> are not qualified.&mdash;So it is
likewise impossible that the <i>ri</i>shis themselves should be
qualified for meditations connected with <i>ri</i>shis, such as
expressed in passages like B<i>ri</i>. Up. II, 2, 4, 'These two are
the <i>ri</i>shis Gautama and Bharadv&acirc;ja; the right Gautama,
the left Bharadv&acirc;ja.'&mdash;Another reason for the
non-qualification of the gods is stated in the following
S&ucirc;tra.</p>
<p>32. And (the devas, &amp;c. are not qualified) on account of
(the words denoting the devas, &amp;c.) being (used) in the sense
of (sphere of) light.</p>
<p>To that sphere of light, the p&ucirc;rvapakshin resumes, which
is stationed in the sky, and during its diurnal revolutions
illumines the world, terms such as &Acirc;ditya, i.e. the names of
devas, are applied, as we know from the use of ordinary language,
and from Vedic complementary passages<a id="footnotetag207" name=
"footnotetag207"></a><a href="#footnote207"><sup>207</sup></a>. But
of a mere sphere of light we cannot understand how it should be
endowed with either a bodily form, consisting of the heart and the
like, or intelligence, or the capability of forming wishes<a id=
"footnotetag208" name="footnotetag208"></a><a href=
"#footnote208"><sup>208</sup></a>. For mere light we know to be,
like earth, entirely devoid of intelligence. The same observation
applies to Agni (fire), and so on. It will perhaps be said that our
objection is not valid, because the personality of the devas is
known from the mantras, arthav&acirc;das, itih&acirc;sas,
pur&acirc;<i>n</i>as, and from the conceptions of ordinary
life<a id="footnotetag209" name="footnotetag209"></a><a href=
"#footnote209"><sup>209</sup></a>; but we contest the relevancy of
this remark. For the conceptions of ordinary life do not constitute
an independent means of knowledge; we rather say that a thing is
known from ordinary life if it is known by the (acknowledged) means
of knowledge, perception, &amp;c. But none of the recognised means
of knowledge, such as perception and the like, apply to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id=
"page218"></a>{218}</span> matter under discussion. Itih&acirc;sas
and pur&acirc;<i>n</i>as again being of human origin, stand
themselves in need of other means of knowledge on which to base.
The arthav&acirc;da passages also, which, as forming syntactical
wholes with the injunctory passages, have merely the purpose of
glorifying (what is enjoined in the latter), cannot be considered
to constitute by themselves reasons for the existence of the
personality, &amp;c. of the devas. The mantras again, which, on the
ground of direct enunciation, &amp;c., are to be employed (at the
different stages of the sacrificial action), have merely the
purpose of denoting things connected with the sacrificial
performance, and do not constitute an independent means of
authoritative knowledge for anything<a id="footnotetag210" name=
"footnotetag210"></a><a href=
"#footnote210"><sup>210</sup></a>.&mdash;For these reasons the
devas, and similar beings, are not qualified for the knowledge of
Brahman.</p>
<p>33. B&acirc;dar&acirc;ya<i>n</i>a, on the other hand,
(maintains) the existence (of qualification for Brahma-vidy&acirc;
on the part of the gods); for there are (passages indicatory of
that).</p>
<p>The expression 'on the other hand' is meant to rebut the
p&ucirc;rvapaksha. The teacher, B&acirc;dar&acirc;ya<i>n</i>a,
maintains the existence of the qualification on the part of the
gods, &amp;c. For, although the qualification of the gods cannot be
admitted with reference to the madhu-vidy&acirc;, and similar
topics of knowledge, in which the gods themselves are implicated,
still they may be qualified for the pure knowledge of Brahman,
qualification in general depending on the presence of desire,
capability, &amp;c.<a id="footnotetag211" name=
"footnotetag211"></a><a href="#footnote211"><sup>211</sup></a> Nor
does the impossibility of qualification in certain cases interfere
with the presence of qualification in those other cases where it is
not impossible. To the case of the gods the same reasoning applies
as to the case of men; for among men also, all are not qualified
for everything, br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>as, for instance, not for the
r&acirc;jas&ucirc;ya-sacrifice<a id="footnotetag212" name=
"footnotetag212"></a><a href="#footnote212"><sup>212</sup></a>.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page219" id=
"page219"></a>{219}</span>
<p>And, with reference to the knowledge of Brahman, Scripture,
moreover, contains express hints notifying that the devas are
qualified; compare, for instance, <i>Br</i>i. Up. I, 4, 10,
'Whatever Deva was awakened (so as to know Brahman) he indeed
became that; and the same with <i>ri</i>shis;' Ch. Up. VIII, 7, 2,
'They said: Well, let us search for that Self by which, if one has
searched it out, all worlds and all desires are obtained. Thus
saying, Indra went forth from the Devas, Viro<i>k</i>ana from the
Asuras.' Similar statements are met with in Sm<i>ri</i>ti, so, for
instance, in the colloquy of the Gandharva and
Y&acirc;j<i>&ntilde;</i>avalkya<a id="footnotetag213" name=
"footnotetag213"></a><a href=
"#footnote213"><sup>213</sup></a>.&mdash;Against the objection
raised in the preceding S&ucirc;tra (32) we argue as follows. Words
like &acirc;ditya, and so on, which denote devas, although having
reference to light and the like, yet convey the idea of certain
divine Selfs (persons) endowed with intelligence and pre-eminent
power; for they are used in that sense in mantras and
arthav&acirc;da passages. For the devas possess, in consequence of
their pre-eminent power, the capability of residing within the
light, and so on, and to assume any form they like. Thus we read in
Scripture, in the arthav&acirc;da passage explaining the words 'ram
of Medh&acirc;tithi,' which form part of the
Subrahma<i>n</i>ya-formula, that 'Indra, having assumed the shape
of a ram, carried off Medh&acirc;tithi, the descendant of
Ka<i>n</i>va' (Sha<i>d</i>v. Br. I, 1). And thus Sm<i>ri</i>ti says
that '&Acirc;ditya, having assumed the shape of a man, came to
Kunt&icirc;.' Moreover, even in such substances as earth,
intelligent ruling beings must be admitted to reside, for that
appears from such scriptural passages as 'the earth spoke,' 'the
waters spoke,' &amp;c. The non-intelligence of light and the like,
in so far as they are mere material elements, is admitted in the
case of the sun (&acirc;ditya), &amp;c. also; but&mdash;as already
remarked&mdash;from the use of the words in mantras and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id=
"page220"></a>{220}</span> arthav&acirc;das it appears that there
are intelligent beings of divine nature (which animate those
material elements).</p>
<p>We now turn to the objection (raised above by the
p&ucirc;rvapakshin) that mantras and arthav&acirc;das, as merely
subserving other purposes, have no power of setting forth the
personality of the devas, and remark that not the circumstance of
subordination or non-subordination to some other purpose, but
rather the presence or absence of a certain idea furnishes a reason
for (our assuming) the existence of something. This is exemplified
by the case of a person who, having set out for some other purpose,
(nevertheless) forms the conviction of the existence of leaves,
grass, and the like, which he sees lying on the road.&mdash;But,
the p&ucirc;rvapakshin may here object, the instance quoted by you
is not strictly analogous. In the case of the wanderer, perception,
whose objects the grass and leaves are, is active, and through it
he forms the conception of their existence. In the case of an
arthav&acirc;da, on the other hand, which, as forming a syntactical
unity with the corresponding injunctory passage, merely subserves
the purpose of glorifying (the latter), it is impossible to
determine any energy having a special object of its own. For in
general any minor syntactical unity, which is included in a more
comprehensive syntactical unity conveying a certain meaning, does
not possess the power of expressing a separate meaning of its own.
Thus, for instance, we derive, from the combination of the three
words constituting the negative sentence, '(Do) not drink wine,'
one meaning only, i.e. a prohibition of drinking wine, and do not
derive an additional meaning, viz. an order to drink wine, from the
combination of the last two words, 'drink wine.'&mdash;To this
objection we reply, that the instance last quoted is not analogous
(to the matter under discussion). The words of the sentence
prohibiting the drinking of wine form only one whole, and on that
account the separate sense which any minor syntactical unity
included in the bigger sentence may possess cannot be accepted. In
the case of injunction and arthav&acirc;da, on the other hand, the
words constituting the arthav&acirc;da form a separate group of
their own which refers to some accomplished <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>{221}</span>
thing<a id="footnotetag214" name="footnotetag214"></a><a href=
"#footnote214"><sup>214</sup></a>, and only subsequently to that,
when it comes to be considered what purpose they subserve, they
enter on the function of glorifying the injunction. Let us examine,
as an illustrative example, the injunctive passage, 'He who is
desirous of prosperity is to offer to V&acirc;yu a white animal.'
All the words contained in this passage are directly connected with
the injunction. This is, however, not the case with the words
constituting the corresponding arthav&acirc;da passage, 'For
V&acirc;yu is the swiftest deity; V&acirc;yu he approaches with his
own share; he leads him to prosperity.' The single words of this
arthav&acirc;da are not grammatically connected with the single
words of the injunction, but form a subordinate unity of their own,
which contains the praise of V&acirc;yu, and glorify the
injunction, only in so far as they give us to understand that the
action enjoined is connected with a distinguished divinity. If the
matter conveyed by the subordinate (arthav&acirc;da) passage can be
known by some other means of knowledge, the arthav&acirc;da acts as
a mere anuv&acirc;da, i.e. a statement referring to something
(already known)<a id="footnotetag215" name=
"footnotetag215"></a><a href="#footnote215"><sup>215</sup></a>.
When its contents are contradicted by other means of knowledge it
acts as a so-called gu<i>n</i>av&acirc;da, i.e. a statement of a
quality<a id="footnotetag216" name="footnotetag216"></a><a href=
"#footnote216"><sup>216</sup></a>. Where, again, neither of the two
mentioned conditions is found, a doubt may arise whether the
arthav&acirc;da is to be taken as a gu<i>n</i>av&acirc;da on
account of the absence of other means of knowledge, or as an
arthav&acirc;da referring to something known (i.e. an
anuv&acirc;da) on account of the absence of contradiction by other
means of proof. The latter alternative is, however, to be embraced
by reflecting people.&mdash;The same reasoning applies to mantras
also.</p>
<p>There is a further reason for assuming the personality of the
gods. The Vedic injunctions, as enjoining sacrificial offerings to
Indra and the other gods, presuppose certain characteristic shapes
of the individual divinities, because <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>{222}</span> without
such the sacrificer could not represent Indra and the other gods to
his mind. And if the divinity were not represented to the mind it
would not be possible to make an offering to it. So Scripture also
says, 'Of that divinity for which the offering is taken he is to
think when about to say vausha<i>t</i>' (Ai. Br. III, 8, 1). Nor is
it possible to consider the essential form (or character) of a
thing to consist in the word only<a id="footnotetag217" name=
"footnotetag217"></a><a href="#footnote217"><sup>217</sup></a>; for
word (denoting) and thing (denoted) are different. He therefore who
admits the authoritativeness of the scriptural word has no right to
deny that the shape of Indra, and the other gods, is such as we
understand it to be from the mantras and
arthav&acirc;das.&mdash;Moreover, itih&acirc;sas and
pur&acirc;<i>n</i>as also&mdash;because based on mantra and
arthav&acirc;da which possess authoritative power in the manner
described&mdash;are capable of setting forth the personality,
&amp;c. of the devas. Itih&acirc;sa and pur&acirc;<i>n</i>a can,
besides, be considered as based on perception also. For what is not
accessible to our perception may have been within the sphere of
perception of people in ancient times. Sm<i>ri</i>ti also declares
that Vy&acirc;sa and others conversed with the gods face to face. A
person maintaining that the people of ancient times were no more
able to converse with the gods than people are at present, would
thereby deny the (incontestable) variety of the world. He might as
well maintain that because there is at present no prince ruling
over the whole earth, there were no such princes in former times; a
position by which the scriptural injunction of the
r&acirc;jas&ucirc;ya-sacrifice<a id="footnotetag218" name=
"footnotetag218"></a><a href="#footnote218"><sup>218</sup></a>
would be stultified. Or he might maintain that in former times the
spheres of duty of the different castes and &acirc;<i>s</i>ramas
were as generally unsettled as they are now, and, on that account,
declare those parts of Scripture which define those different
duties to be purposeless. It is therefore altogether
unobjectionable to assume that the men of ancient times, in
consequence of their eminent religious <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>{223}</span> merit,
conversed with the gods face to face. Sm<i>ri</i>ti also declares
that 'from the reading of the Veda there results intercourse with
the favourite divinity' (Yoga S&ucirc;tra II, 44). And that Yoga
does, as Sm<i>ri</i>ti declares, lead to the acquirement of
extraordinary powers, such as subtlety of body, and so on, is a
fact which cannot be set aside by a mere arbitrary denial.
Scripture also proclaims the greatness of Yoga, 'When, as earth,
water, light, heat, and ether arise, the fivefold quality of Yoga
takes place, then there is no longer illness, old age, or pain for
him who has obtained a body produced by the fire of Yoga'
(<i>S</i>vet. Up. II, 12). Nor have we the right to measure by our
capabilities the capability of the <i>ri</i>shis who see the
mantras and br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a passages (i.e. the
Veda).&mdash;From all this it appears that the itih&acirc;sas and
pur&acirc;<i>n</i>as have an adequate basis.&mdash;And the
conceptions of ordinary life also must not be declared to be
unfounded, if it is at all possible to accept them.</p>
<p>The general result is that we have the right to conceive the
gods as possessing personal existence, on the ground of mantras,
arthav&acirc;das, itih&acirc;sas, pur&acirc;<i>n</i>as, and
ordinarily prevailing ideas. And as the gods may thus be in the
condition of having desires and so on, they must be considered as
qualified for the knowledge of Brahman. Moreover, the declarations
which Scripture makes concerning gradual emancipation<a id=
"footnotetag219" name="footnotetag219"></a><a href=
"#footnote219"><sup>219</sup></a> agree with this latter
supposition only.</p>
<p>34. Grief of him (i.e. of J&acirc;na<i>s</i>ruti) (arose) on
account of his hearing a disrespectful speech about himself; on
account of the rushing on of that (grief) (Raikva called him
<i>S</i>&ucirc;dra); for it (the grief) is pointed at (by
Raikva).</p>
<p>(In the preceding adhikara<i>n</i>a) the exclusiveness of the
claim of men to knowledge has been refuted, and it has been
declared that the gods, &amp;c. also possess such a claim. The
present adhikara<i>n</i>a is entered on for the purpose of removing
the doubt whether, as the exclusiveness of the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>{224}</span> claim of
twice-born men is capable of refutation, the <i>S</i>&ucirc;dras
also possess such a claim.</p>
<p>The p&ucirc;rvapakshin maintains that the <i>S</i>&ucirc;dras
also have such a claim, because they may be in the position of
desiring that knowledge, and because they are capable of it; and
because there is no scriptural prohibition (excluding them from
knowledge) analogous to the text, 'Therefore<a id="footnotetag220"
name="footnotetag220"></a><a href="#footnote220"><sup>220</sup></a>
the <i>S</i>&ucirc;dra is unfit for sacrificing' (Taitt.
Sa<i>m</i>h. VII, 1, 1, 6). The reason, moreover, which
disqualifies the <i>S</i>&ucirc;dras for sacrificial works, viz.
their being without the sacred fires, does not invalidate their
qualification for knowledge, as knowledge can be apprehended by
those also who are without the fires. There is besides an
inferential mark supporting the claim of the <i>S</i>&ucirc;dras;
for in the so-called sa<i>m</i>varga-knowledge he (Raikva) refers
to J&acirc;na<i>s</i>ruti Pautr&acirc;ya<i>n</i>a, who wishes to
learn from him, by the name of <i>S</i>&ucirc;dra 'Fie, necklace
and carnage be thine, O <i>S</i>&ucirc;dra, together with the cows'
(Ch. Up. IV, 2, 3). Sm<i>ri</i>ti moreover speaks of Vid&ucirc;ra
and others who were born from <i>S</i>&ucirc;dra mothers as
possessing eminent knowledge.&mdash;Hence the <i>S</i>&ucirc;dra
has a claim to the knowledge of Brahman.</p>
<p>To this we reply that the <i>S</i>&ucirc;dras have no such
claim, on account of their not studying the Veda. A person who has
studied the Veda and understood its sense is indeed qualified for
Vedic matters; but a <i>S</i>&ucirc;dra does not study the Veda,
for such study demands as its antecedent the upanayana-ceremony,
and that ceremony belongs to the three (higher) castes only. The
mere circumstance of being in a condition of desire does not
furnish a reason for qualification, if capability is absent. Mere
temporal capability again does not constitute a reason for
qualification, spiritual capability being required in spiritual
matters. And spiritual capability is (in the case of the
<i>S</i>&ucirc;dras) excluded by their being excluded from the
study of the Veda.&mdash;The Vedic statement, moreover, that the
<i>S</i>&ucirc;dra is unfit for sacrifices intimates, because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id=
"page225"></a>{225}</span> founded on reasoning, that he is unfit
for knowledge also; for the argumentation is the same in both
cases<a id="footnotetag221" name="footnotetag221"></a><a href=
"#footnote221"><sup>221</sup></a>.&mdash;With reference to the
p&ucirc;rvapakshin's opinion that the fact of the word
'<i>S</i>&ucirc;dra' being enounced in the
sa<i>m</i>varga-knowledge constitutes an inferential mark (of the
<i>S</i>&ucirc;dra's qualification for knowledge), we remark that
that inferential mark has no force, on account of the absence of
arguments. For the statement of an inferential mark possesses the
power of intimation only in consequence of arguments being adduced;
but no such arguments are brought forward in the passage
quoted.<a id="footnotetag222" name="footnotetag222"></a><a href=
"#footnote222"><sup>222</sup></a> Besides, the word
'<i>S</i>&ucirc;dra' which occurs in the
sa<i>m</i>varga-vidy&acirc; would establish a claim on the part of
the <i>S</i>&ucirc;dras to that one vidy&acirc; only, not to all
vidy&acirc;s. In reality, however, it is powerless, because
occurring in an arthav&acirc;da, to establish the
<i>S</i>&ucirc;dras' claim to anything.&mdash;The word
'<i>S</i>&ucirc;dra' can moreover be made to agree with the context
in which it occurs in the following manner. When
J&acirc;na<i>s</i>ruti Pautr&acirc;ya<i>n</i>a heard himself spoken
of with disrespect by the flamingo ('How can you speak of him,
being what he is, as if he were like Raikva with the car?' IV, 1,
3), grief (su<i>k</i>) arose in his mind, and to that grief the
<i>ri</i>shi Raikva alludes with the word <i>S</i>&ucirc;dra, in
order to show thereby his knowledge of what is remote. This
explanation must be accepted because a (real) born
<i>S</i>&ucirc;dra is not qualified (for the
sa<i>m</i>varga-vidy&acirc;). If it be asked how the grief
(su<i>k</i>) which had arisen in J&acirc;nasruti's mind can be
referred to by means of the word <i>S</i>&ucirc;dra, we reply: On
account of the rushing on (&acirc;drava<i>n</i>a) of the grief. For
we may etymologise the word <i>S</i>&ucirc;dra by dividing it into
its parts, either as 'he rushed into grief (<i>S</i>u<i>k</i>am
abhidudr&acirc;va) or as 'grief rushed on <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>{226}</span> him,' or
as 'he in his grief rushed to Raikva;' while on the other hand it
is impossible to accept the word in its ordinary conventional
sense. The circumstance (of the king actually being grieved) is
moreover expressly touched upon in the legend<a id="footnotetag223"
name="footnotetag223"></a><a href=
"#footnote223"><sup>223</sup></a>.</p>
<p>35. And because the kshattriyahood (of J&acirc;na<i>s</i>ruti)
is understood from the inferential mark (supplied by his being
mentioned) later on with <i>K</i>aitraratha (who was a kshattriya
himself).</p>
<p>J&acirc;na<i>s</i>ruti cannot have been a <i>S</i>&ucirc;dra by
birth for that reason also that his being a kshattriya is
understood from an inferential sign, viz. his being mentioned
together (in one chapter) with the kshattriya <i>K</i>aitraratha
Abhiprat&acirc;rin. For, later on, i.e. in the passage
complementary to the sa<i>m</i>varga-vidy&acirc;, a kshattriya
<i>K</i>aitrarathi Abhiprat&acirc;rin is glorified, 'Once while
<i>S</i>aunaka K&acirc;peya and Abhiprat&acirc;rin K&acirc;kshaseni
were being waited on at their meal a religious student begged of
them' (Ch. Up. IV, 3, 5). That this Abhiprat&acirc;rin was a
<i>K</i>aitrarathi (i.e. a descendant of <i>K</i>itraratha) we have
to infer from his connexion with a K&acirc;peya. For we know (from
<i>S</i>ruti) about the connexion of <i>K</i>itraratha himself with
the K&acirc;peyas ('the K&acirc;peyas made <i>K</i>itraratha
perform that sacrifice;' T&acirc;<i>nd</i>ya. Br. XX, 12, 5), and
as a rule sacrificers of one and the same family employ officiating
priests of one and the same family. Moreover, as we understand from
Scripture ('from him a <i>K</i>aitrarathi descended who was a
prince<a id="footnotetag224" name="footnotetag224"></a><a href=
"#footnote224"><sup>224</sup></a>') that he (<i>K</i>aitraratha)
was a prince, we must <span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id=
"page227"></a>{227}</span> understand him to have been a
kshattriya. The fact now of J&acirc;na<i>s</i>ruti being praised in
the same vidy&acirc; with the kshattriya Abhiprat&acirc;rin
intimates that the former also was a kshattriya. For as a rule
equals are mentioned together with equals. That
J&acirc;na<i>s</i>ruti was a kshattriya we moreover conclude from
his sending his door-keeper and from other similar signs of power
(mentioned in the text).&mdash;Hence the <i>S</i>&ucirc;dras are
not qualified (for the knowledge of Brahman).</p>
<p>36. On account of the reference to ceremonial purifications (in
the case of the higher castes) and on account of their absence
being declared (in the case of the <i>S</i>&ucirc;dras).</p>
<p>That the <i>S</i>&ucirc;dras are not qualified, follows from
that circumstance also that in different places of the vidy&acirc;s
such ceremonies as the upanayana and the like are referred to.
Compare, for instance, <i>S</i>at. Br. XI, 5, 3, 13, 'He initiated
him as a pupil;' Ch. Up. VII, 1, 1, 'Teach me, Sir! thus he
approached him;' Pra. Up. I, 1, 'Devoted to Brahman, firm in
Brahman, seeking for the highest Brahman they, carrying fuel in
their hands, approached the venerable Pippal&acirc;da, thinking
that he would teach them all that.'&mdash;Thus the following
passage also, 'He without having made them undergo the upanayana
(said) to them' (Ch. Up. V, 11, 7), shows that the upanayana is a
well-established ceremony<a id="footnotetag225" name=
"footnotetag225"></a><a href=
"#footnote225"><sup>225</sup></a>.&mdash;With reference to the
<i>S</i>&ucirc;dras, on the other hand, the absence of ceremonies
is frequently mentioned; so, for instance, Manu X, 4, where they
are spoken of as 'once born' only ('the <i>S</i>&ucirc;dra is the
fourth caste, once-born'), and Manu X, 126, 'In the
<i>S</i>&ucirc;dra there is not any sin, and he is not fit for any
ceremony.'</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id=
"page228"></a>{228}</span>
<p>37. And on account of (Gautama) proceeding (to initiate
J&acirc;b&acirc;la) on the ascertainment of (his) not being that
(i.e. a <i>S</i>&ucirc;dra).</p>
<p>The <i>S</i>&ucirc;dras are not qualified for that reason also
that Gautama, having ascertained J&acirc;b&acirc;la not to be a
<i>S</i>&ucirc;dra from his speaking the truth, proceeded to
initiate and instruct him. 'None who is not a br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a
would thus speak out. Go and fetch fuel, friend, I shall initiate
you. You have not swerved from the truth' (Ch. Up. IV, 4, 5); which
scriptural passage furnishes an inferential sign (of the
<i>S</i>&ucirc;dras not being capable of initiation).</p>
<p>38. And on account of the prohibition, in Sm<i>ri</i>ti, of (the
<i>S</i>&ucirc;dras') hearing and studying (the Veda) and (knowing
and performing) (Vedic) matters.</p>
<p>The <i>S</i>&ucirc;dras are not qualified for that reason also
that Sm<i>ri</i>ti prohibits their hearing the Veda, their studying
the Veda, and their understanding and performing Vedic matters. The
prohibition of hearing the Veda is conveyed by the following
passages: 'The ears of him who hears the Veda are to be filled with
(molten) lead and lac,' and 'For a <i>S</i>&ucirc;dra is (like) a
cemetery, therefore (the Veda) is not to be read in the vicinity of
a <i>S</i>&ucirc;dra.' From this latter passage the prohibition of
studying the Veda results at once; for how should he study
Scripture in whose vicinity it is not even to be read? There is,
moreover, an express prohibition (of the <i>S</i>&ucirc;dras
studying the Veda). 'His tongue is to be slit if he pronounces it;
his body is to be cut through if he preserves it.' The prohibitions
of hearing and studying the Veda already imply the prohibition of
the knowledge and performance of Vedic matters; there are, however,
express prohibitions also, such as 'he is not to impart knowledge
to the <i>S</i>&ucirc;dra,' and 'to the twice-born belong study,
sacrifice, and the bestowal of gifts.'&mdash;From those
<i>S</i>&ucirc;dras, however, who, like Vidura and 'the religious
hunter,' acquire knowledge in consequence of the after effects of
former deeds, the fruit of their knowledge cannot be withheld,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id=
"page229"></a>{229}</span> since knowledge in all cases brings
about its fruit. Sm<i>ri</i>ti, moreover, declares that all the
four castes are qualified for acquiring the knowledge of the
itih&acirc;sas and pur&acirc;<i>n</i>as; compare the passage, 'He
is to teach the four castes' (Mah&acirc;bh.).&mdash;It remains,
however, a settled point that they do not possess any such
qualification with regard to the Veda.</p>
<p>39. (The pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a is Brahman), on account of the
trembling (predicated of the whole world).</p>
<p>The discussion of qualification for Brahma-knowledge&mdash;on
which we entered as an opportunity offered&mdash;being finished we
return to our chief topic, i.e. the enquiry into the purport of the
Ved&acirc;nta-texts.&mdash;We read (Ka. Up. II, 6, 2), 'Whatever
there is, the whole world when gone forth trembles in the
pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a. It (the pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a) is a great terror,
a raised thunderbolt. Those who know it become immortal<a id=
"footnotetag226" name="footnotetag226"></a><a href=
"#footnote226"><sup>226</sup></a>.'&mdash;This passage declares
that this whole world trembles, abiding in pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a, and
that there is raised something very terrible, called a thunderbolt,
and that through its knowledge immortality is obtained. But as it
is not immediately clear what the pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a is, and what
that terrible thunderbolt, a discussion arises.</p>
<p>The p&ucirc;rvapakshin maintains that, in accordance with the
ordinary meaning of the term, pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a denotes the air
with its five modifications, that the word 'thunderbolt' also is to
be taken in its ordinary sense, and that thus the whole passage
contains a glorification of air. For, he says, this whole world
trembles, abiding within air with its five forms&mdash;which is
here called pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a&mdash;and the terrible thunderbolts
also spring from air (or wind) as their cause. For in the air,
people say, when it manifests itself in the form of Parjanya,
lightning, thunder, rain, and thunderbolts manifest
themselves.&mdash;Through the knowledge of that air immortality
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id=
"page230"></a>{230}</span> also can be obtained; for another
scriptural passage says, 'Air is everything by itself, and air is
all things together. He who knows this conquers death.'&mdash;We
therefore conclude that the same air is to be understood in the
passage under discussion.</p>
<p>To this we make the following reply.&mdash;Brahman only can be
meant, on account of what precedes as well as what follows. In the
preceding as well as the subsequent part of the chapter Brahman
only is spoken of; how then can it be supposed that in the
intermediate part all at once the air should be referred to? The
immediately preceding passage runs as follows, 'That only is called
the Bright, that is called Brahman, that alone is called the
Immortal. All worlds are contained in it, and no one goes beyond
it.' That the Brahman there spoken of forms the topic of our
passage also, we conclude, firstly, from proximity; and, secondly,
from the circumstance that in the clause, 'The whole world trembles
in pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a' we recognise a quality of Brahman, viz. its
constituting the abode of the whole world. That the word
pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a can denote the highest Self also, appears from
such passages as 'the pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a of pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a'
(B<i>ri</i>. Up. IV, 4, 18). Being the cause of trembling,
moreover, is a quality which properly appertains to the highest
Self only, not to mere air. Thus Scripture says, 'No mortal lives
by the pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a and the breath that goes down. We live by
another in whom these two repose' (Ka. Up. II, 5 5). And also in
the passage subsequent to the one under discussion, ('From terror
of it fire burns, from terror the sun burns, from terror Indra and
V&acirc;yu, and Death as the fifth run away,') Brahman, and not the
air, must be supposed to be spoken of, since the subject of that
passage is represented as the cause of fear on the part of the
whole world inclusive of the air itself. Thence we again conclude
that the passage under discussion also refers to Brahman, firstly,
on the ground of proximity; and, secondly, because we recognise a
quality of Brahman, viz. its being the cause of fear, in the words,
'A great terror, a raised thunderbolt.' The word 'thunderbolt' is
here used to denote a cause of fear in general. Thus in ordinary
life also a man strictly <span class="pagenum"><a name="page231"
id="page231"></a>{231}</span> carries out a king's command because
he fearfully considers in his mind, 'A thunderbolt (i.e. the king's
wrath, or threatened punishment) is hanging over my head; it might
fall if I did not carry out his command.' In the same manner this
whole world inclusive of fire, air, sun, and so on, regularly
carries on its manifold functions from fear of Brahman; hence
Brahman as inspiring fear is compared to a thunderbolt. Similarly,
another scriptural passage, whose topic is Brahman, declares, 'From
terror of it the wind blows, from terror the sun rises; from terror
of it Agni and Indra, yea, Death runs as the fifth.'&mdash;That
Brahman is what is referred to in our passage, further follows from
the declaration that the fruit of its cognition is immortality. For
that immortality is the fruit of the knowledge of Brahman is known,
for instance, from the mantra, 'A man who knows him only passes
over death, there is no other path to go' (<i>S</i>vet. Up. VI,
15).&mdash;That immortality which the p&ucirc;rvapakshin asserts to
be sometimes represented as the fruit of the knowledge of the air
is a merely relative one; for there (i.e. in the chapter from which
the passage is quoted) at first the highest Self is spoken of, by
means of a new topic being started (B<i>ri</i>. Up. III, 4), and
thereupon the inferior nature of the air and so on is referred to.
('Everything else is evil.')&mdash;That in the passage under
discussion the highest Self is meant appears finally from the
general subject-matter; for the question (asked by Na<i>k</i>iketas
in I, 2, 14, 'That which thou seest as neither this nor that, as
neither effect nor cause, as neither past nor future tell me that')
refers to the highest Self.</p>
<p>40. The light (is Brahman), on account of that (Brahman) being
seen (in the scriptural passage).</p>
<p>We read in Scripture, 'Thus does that serene being, arising from
this body, appear in its own form as soon as it has approached the
highest light' (Ch. Up. VIII, 12, 3). Here the doubt arises whether
the word 'light' denotes the (physical) light, which is the object
of sight and dispels darkness, or the highest Brahman.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id=
"page232"></a>{232}</span>
<p>The p&ucirc;rvapakshin maintains that the word 'light' denotes
the well-known (physical) light, because that is the conventional
sense of the word. For while it is to be admitted that in another
passage, discussed under I, 1, 24, the word 'light' does, owing to
the general topic of the chapter, divest itself of its ordinary
meaning and denote Brahman, there is in our passage no similar
reason for setting the ordinary meaning aside. Moreover, it is
stated in the chapter treating of the n&acirc;<i>d</i>&icirc;s of
the body, that a man going to final release reaches the sun ('When
he departs from this body then he departs upwards by those very
rays;' Ch. Up. VIII, 6, 5). Hence we conclude that the word 'light'
denotes, in our passage, the ordinary light.</p>
<p>To this we make the following reply.&mdash;The word 'light' can
denote the highest Brahman only, on account of that being seen. We
see that in the whole chapter Brahman is carried on as the topic of
discussion. For the Self, which is free from sin, &amp;c. is
introduced as the general subject-matter in VIII, 7, 1 ('the Self
which is free from sin'); it is thereupon set forth as that which
is to be searched out and to be understood (VIII, 7, 1); it is
carried on by means of the clauses, 'I shall explain that further
to you' (VIII, 9, 3 ff.); after that freedom from body is said to
belong to it, because it is one with light ('when he is free from
the body then neither pleasure nor pain touches him,' VIII, 12,
1)&mdash;and freedom from body is not possible outside
Brahman&mdash;and it is finally qualified as 'the highest light,
the highest person' (VIII, 12, 3).&mdash;Against the statement,
made by the p&ucirc;rvapakshin, that Scripture speaks of a man
going to release as reaching the sun, we remark, that the release
there referred to is not the ultimate one, since it is said to be
connected with going and departing upwards. That the ultimate
release has nothing to do with going and departing upwards we shall
show later on.</p>
<p>41. The ether is (Brahman), as it is designated as something
different, &amp;c. (from name and form).</p>
<p>Scripture says, 'He who is called ether,
(&acirc;k&acirc;<i>s</i>a) is the revealer of all forms and names.
That within which these <span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id=
"page233"></a>{233}</span> forms and names are contained is the
Brahman, the Immortal, the Self (Ch. Up. VIII, 14, 1).</p>
<p>There arising a doubt whether that which here is called ether is
the highest Brahman or the ordinary elemental ether, the
p&ucirc;rvapakshin declares that the latter alternative is to be
embraced, firstly, because it is founded on the conventional
meaning of the word 'ether;' and, secondly, because the
circumstance of revealing names and forms can very well be
reconciled with the elemental ether, as that which affords room
(for all things). Moreover, the passage contains no clear
indicatory mark of Brahman, such as creative power, and the
like.</p>
<p>To this we reply, that the word 'ether' can here denote the
highest Brahman only, because it is designated as a different
thing, &amp;c. For the clause, 'That within which these two are
contained is Brahman,' designates the ether as something different
from names and forms. But, excepting Brahman, there is nothing
whatever different from name and form, since the entire world of
effects is evolved exclusively by names and forms. Moreover, the
complete revealing of names and forms cannot be accomplished by
anything else but Brahman, according to the text which declares
Brahman's creative agency, 'Let me enter (into those beings) with
this living Self (j&icirc;va &acirc;tman), and evolve names and
forms' (Ch. Up. VI, 3, 2). But&mdash;it may be said&mdash;from this
very passage it is apparent that the living Self also (i.e. the
individual soul) possesses revealing power with regard to names and
forms.&mdash;True, we reply, but what the passage really wishes to
intimate, is the non-difference (of the individual soul from the
highest Self). And the very statement concerning the revealing of
names and forms implies the statement of signs indicatory of
Brahman, viz. creative power and the like.&mdash;Moreover, the
terms 'the Brahman, the Immortal, the Self' (VIII, 14) indicate
that Brahman is spoken of.</p>
<p>42. And (on account of the designation) (of the highest Self) as
different (from the individual soul) in the states of deep sleep
and departing.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id=
"page234"></a>{234}</span>
<p>In the sixth prap&acirc;<i>th</i>aka of the
B<i>ri</i>had&acirc;ra<i>n</i>yaka there is given, in reply to the
question, 'Who is that Self?' a lengthy exposition of the nature of
the Self, 'He who is within the heart, among the
pr&acirc;<i>n</i>as, the person of light, consisting of knowledge'
(B<i>ri</i>. Up. IV, 3, 7). Here the doubt arises, whether the
passage merely aims at making an additional statement about the
nature of the transmigrating soul (known already from other
sources), or at establishing the nature of the non-transmigrating
Self.</p>
<p>The p&ucirc;rvapakshin maintains that the passage is concerned
with the nature of the transmigrating soul, on account of the
introductory and concluding statements. For the introductory
statement, 'He among the pr&acirc;<i>n</i>as who consists of
knowledge,' contains marks indicatory of the embodied soul, and so
likewise the concluding passage, 'And that great unborn Self is he
who consists of cognition,' &amp;c. (IV, 4, 22). We must therefore
adhere to the same subject-matter in the intermediate passages
also, and look on them as setting forth the same embodied Self,
represented in its different states, viz. the waking state, and so
on.</p>
<p>In reply to this, we maintain that the passage aims only at
giving information about the highest Lord, not at making additional
statements about the embodied soul.&mdash;Why?&mdash;On account of
the highest Lord being designated as different from the embodied
soul, in the states of deep sleep and of departing from the body.
His difference from the embodied soul in the state of deep sleep is
declared in the following passage, 'This person embraced by the
intelligent (pr&acirc;j<i>&ntilde;</i>a) Self knows nothing that is
without, nothing that is within.' Here the term, 'the person,' must
mean the embodied soul; for of him it is possible to deny that he
knows, because he, as being the knower, may know what is within and
without. The 'intelligent Self,' on the other hand, is the highest
Lord, because he is never dissociated from intelligence,
i.e.&mdash;in his case&mdash;all-embracing
knowledge.&mdash;Similarly, the passage treating of departure, i.e.
death ('this bodily Self mounted by the intelligent Self moves
along groaning'), refers to the highest Lord as different from the
individual Self. There also we have to understand by the 'embodied
one' the individual <span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id=
"page235"></a>{235}</span> soul which is the Lord of the body,
while the 'intelligent one' is again the Lord. We thus understand
that 'on account of his being designated as something different, in
the states of deep sleep and departure,' the highest Lord forms the
subject of the passage.&mdash;With reference to the
p&ucirc;rvapakshin's assertion that the entire chapter refers to
the embodied Self, because indicatory marks of the latter are found
in its beginning, middle, and end, we remark that in the first
place the introductory passage ('He among the pr&acirc;<i>n</i>as
who consists of cognition') does not aim at setting forth the
character of the transmigrating Self, but rather, while merely
referring to the nature of the transmigrating Self as something
already known, aims at declaring its identity with the highest
Brahman; for it is manifest that the immediately subsequent
passage, 'as if thinking, as if moving'<a id="footnotetag227" name=
"footnotetag227"></a><a href="#footnote227"><sup>227</sup></a>,
aims at discarding the attributes of the transmigrating Self. The
concluding passage again is analogous to the initial one; for the
words, 'And that great unborn Self is he who,' &amp;c., mean: We
have shown that that same cognitional Self, which is observed among
the pr&acirc;<i>n</i>as, is the great unborn Self, i.e. the highest
Lord&mdash;He, again, who imagines that the passages intervening
(between the two quoted) aim at setting forth the nature of the
transmigrating Self by representing it in the waking state, and so
on, is like a man who setting out towards the east, wants to set
out at the same time towards the west. For in representing the
states of waking, and so on, the passage does not aim at describing
the soul as subject to different states or transmigration, but
rather as free from all particular conditions and transmigration.
This is evident from the circumstance that on Janaka's question,
which is repeated in every section, 'Speak on for the sake of
emancipation,' Yaj<i>&ntilde;</i>avalkya replies each time, 'By all
that he is not affected, for that person is not attached to
anything' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. IV, 3, 14-16). And later on he says (IV,
3, 22), 'He is not followed by <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page236" id="page236"></a>{236}</span> good, not followed by evil,
for he has then overcome all the sorrows of the heart.' We have,
therefore, to conclude that the chapter exclusively aims at setting
forth the nature of the non-transmigrating Self.</p>
<p>43. And on account of such words as Lord, &amp;c.</p>
<p>That the chapter aims at setting forth the nature of the
non-transmigrating Self, we have to conclude from that circumstance
also that there occur in it terms such as Lord and so on,
intimating the nature of the non-transmigrating Self, and others
excluding the nature of the transmigrating Self. To the first class
belongs, for instance, 'He is the lord of all, the king of all
things, the protector of all things.' To the latter class belongs
the passage, 'He does not become greater by good works, nor smaller
by evil works.'&mdash;From all which we conclude that the chapter
refers to the non-transmigrating highest Lord.</p>

<h4>FOURTH P&Acirc;DA.</h4>
<center>REVERENCE TO THE HIGHEST SELF!</center>
<p>1. If it be said that some (mention) that which is based on
inference (i.e. the pradh&acirc;na); we deny this, because (the
term alluded to) refers to what is contained in the simile of the
body (i.e. the body itself); and (that the text) shows.</p>
<p>In the preceding part of this work&mdash;as whose topic there
has been set forth an enquiry into Brahman&mdash;we have at first
defined Brahman (I, 1, 2); we have thereupon refuted the objection
that that definition applies to the pradh&acirc;na also, by showing
that there is no scriptural authority for the latter (I, 1, 5), and
we have shown in detail that the common purport of all
Ved&acirc;nta-texts is to set forth the doctrine that Brahman, and
not the pradh&acirc;<i>n</i>a, is the cause of the world. Here,
however, the S&acirc;@nkhya again raises an objection which he
considers not to have been finally disposed of.</p>
<p>It has not, he says, been satisfactorily proved that there is no
scriptural authority for the pradh&acirc;na; for some
<i>s</i>&acirc;kh&acirc;s contain expressions which seem to convey
the idea of the pradh&acirc;na. From this it follows that Kapila
and other supreme <i>ri</i>shis maintain the doctrine of the
pradh&acirc;na being the general cause only because it is based on
the Veda.&mdash;As long therefore as it has not been proved that
those passages to which the S&acirc;@nkhyas refer have a different
meaning (i.e. do not allude to the pradh&acirc;na), all our
previous argumentation as to the omniscient Brahman being the cause
of the world must be considered as unsettled. We therefore now
begin a new chapter which aims at proving that those passages
actually have a different meaning.</p>
<p>The S&acirc;@nkhyas maintain that that also which is based on
inference, i.e. the pradh&acirc;na, is perceived in the text of
some <i>s</i>&acirc;kh&acirc;s. We read, for instance, they say, in
the K&acirc;<i>th</i>aka (I, 3, 11), 'Beyond the Great there is the
Undeveloped, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page238" id=
"page238"></a>{238}</span> beyond the Undeveloped there is the
Person.' There we recognise, named by the same names and enumerated
in the same order, the three entities with which we are acquainted
from the S&acirc;@nkhya-sm<i>ri</i>ti, viz. the great principle,
the Undeveloped (the pradh&acirc;na), and the soul<a id=
"footnotetag228" name="footnotetag228"></a><a href=
"#footnote228"><sup>228</sup></a>. That by the Undeveloped is meant
the pradh&acirc;na is to be concluded from the common use of
Sm<i>ri</i>ti and from the etymological interpretation of which the
word admits, the pradh&acirc;na being called undeveloped because it
is devoid of sound and other qualities. It cannot therefore be
asserted that there is no scriptural authority for the
pradh&acirc;na. And this pradh&acirc;na vouched for by Scripture we
declare to be the cause of the world, on the ground of Scripture,
Sm<i>ri</i>ti, and ratiocination.</p>
<p>Your reasoning, we reply, is not valid. The passage from the
K&acirc;<i>th</i>aka quoted by you intimates by no means the
existence of that great principle and that Undeveloped which are
known from the S&acirc;@nkhya-sm<i>ri</i>ti. We do not recognise
there the pradh&acirc;na of the S&acirc;@nkhyas, i.e. an
independent general cause consisting of three constituting
elements; we merely recognise the word 'Undeveloped,' which does
not denote any particular determined thing, but may&mdash;owing to
its etymological meaning, 'that which is not developed, not
manifest'&mdash;denote anything subtle and difficult to
distinguish. The S&acirc;@nkhyas indeed give to the word a settled
meaning, as they apply it to the pradh&acirc;na; but then that
meaning is valid for their system only, and has no force in the
determination of the sense of the Veda. Nor does mere equality of
position prove equality of being, unless the latter be recognised
independently. None but a fool would think a cow to be a horse
because he sees it tied in the usual place of a horse. We,
moreover, conclude, on the strength of the general subject-matter,
that the passage does not refer to the pradh&acirc;na the fiction
of the S&acirc;@nkhyas, 'on account of there being referred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id=
"page239"></a>{239}</span> to that which is contained in the simile
of the body.' This means that the body which is mentioned in the
simile of the chariot is here referred to as the Undeveloped. We
infer this from the general subject-matter of the passage and from
the circumstance of nothing else remaining.&mdash;The immediately
preceding part of the chapter exhibits the simile in which the
Self, the body, and so on, are compared to the lord of a chariot, a
chariot, &amp;c., 'Know the Self to be the lord of the chariot, the
body to be the chariot, the intellect the charioteer, and the mind
the reins. The senses they call the horses, the objects of the
senses their roads. When he (the Self) is in union with the body,
the senses and the mind, then wise people call him the enjoyer.'
The text then goes on to say that he whose senses, &amp;c. are not
well controlled enters into sa<i>m</i>s&acirc;ra, while he who has
them under control reaches the end of the journey, the highest
place of Vish<i>n</i>u. The question then arises: What is the end
of the journey, the highest place of Vish<i>n</i>u? Whereupon the
text explains that the highest Self which is higher than the
senses, &amp;c., spoken of is the end of the journey, the highest
place of Vish<i>n</i>u. 'Beyond the senses there are the objects,
beyond the objects there is the mind, beyond the mind there is the
intellect, the great Self is beyond the intellect. Beyond the great
there is the Undeveloped, beyond the Undeveloped there is the
Person. Beyond the Person there is nothing&mdash;this is the goal,
the highest Road.' In this passage we recognise the senses, &amp;c.
which in the preceding simile had been compared to horses and so
on, and we thus avoid the mistake of abandoning the matter in hand
and taking up a new subject. The senses, the intellect, and the
mind are referred to in both passages under the same names. The
objects (in the second passage) are the objects which are (in the
former passage) designated as the roads of the senses; that the
objects are beyond (higher than) the senses is known from the
scriptural passage representing the senses as grahas, i.e.
graspers, and the objects as atigrahas, i.e. superior to the grahas
(B<i>ri</i> Up. III, 2). The mind (manas) again is superior to the
objects, because the relation of the senses and their objects is
based on the mind. The intellect <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page240" id="page240"></a>{240}</span> (buddhi) is higher than the
mind, since the objects of enjoyment are conveyed to the soul by
means of the intellect. Higher than the intellect is the great Self
which was represented as the lord of the chariot in the passage,
'Know the Self to be the lord of the chariot.' That the same Self
is referred to in both passages is manifest from the repeated use
of the word 'Self;' that the Self is superior to intelligence is
owing to the circumstance that the enjoyer is naturally superior to
the instrument of enjoyment. The Self is appropriately called great
as it is the master.&mdash;Or else the phrase 'the great Self' may
here denote the intellect of the first-born Hira<i>n</i>yagarbha
which is the basis of all intellects; in accordance with the
following Sm<i>ri</i>ti-passage it is called mind, the great one;
reflection, Brahman; the stronghold, intellect; enunciation, the
Lord; highest knowledge, consciousness; thought, remembrance<a id=
"footnotetag229" name="footnotetag229"></a><a href=
"#footnote229"><sup>229</sup></a>, and likewise with the following
scriptural passage, 'He (Hira<i>n</i>ya-garbha) who first creates
Brahman and delivers the Vedas to him' (<i>S</i>vet. Up. VI, 18).
The intellect, which in the former passage had been referred to
under its common name buddhi, is here mentioned separately, since
it may be represented as superior to our human intellects. On this
latter explanation of the term 'the great Self,' we must assume
that the personal Self which in the simile had been compared to the
charioteer is, in the latter passage, included in the highest
person (mentioned last); to which there is no objection, since in
reality the personal Self and the highest Self are
identical.&mdash;Thus there remains now the body only which had
before been compared to a chariot. We therefore conclude
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id=
"page241"></a>{241}</span> that the text after having enumerated
the senses and all the other things mentioned before, in order to
point out the highest place, points out by means of the one
remaining word, viz. avyakta, the only thing remaining out of those
which had been mentioned before, viz. the body. The entire passage
aims at conveying the knowledge of the unity of the inward Self and
Brahman, by describing the soul's passing through
sa<i>m</i>s&acirc;ra and release under the form of a simile in
which the body, &amp;c. of the soul&mdash;which is affected by
Nescience and therefore joined to a body, senses, mind, intellect,
objects, sensations, &amp;c.&mdash;are compared to a chariot, and
so on.&mdash;In accordance with this the subsequent verse states
the difficulty of knowing the highest place of Vish<i>n</i>u ('the
Self is hidden in all beings and does not shine forth, but it is
seen by subtle seers through their sharp and subtle intellect'),
and after that the next verse declares Yoga to be the means of
attaining that cognition. 'A wise man should keep down speech in
the mind, he should keep down the mind in intelligence,
intelligence he should keep down within the great Self, and he
should keep that within the quiet Self.'&mdash;That means: The wise
man should restrain the activity of the outer organs such as
speech, &amp;c., and abide within the mind only; he should further
restrain the mind which is intent on doubtful external objects
within intelligence, whose characteristic mark is decision,
recognising that indecision is evil; he should further restrain
intelligence within the great Self, i.e. the individual soul or
else the fundamental intellect; he should finally fix the great
Self on the calm Self, i.e. the highest Self, the highest goal, of
which the whole chapter treats.&mdash;If we in this manner review
the general context, we perceive that there is no room for the
pradh&acirc;na imagined by the S&acirc;nkhyas.</p>
<p>2. But the subtle (body is meant by the term avyakta) on account
of its capability (of being so designated).</p>
<p>It has been asserted, under the preceding S&ucirc;tra, that the
term 'the Undeveloped' signifies, on account of the general
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id=
"page242"></a>{242}</span> subject-matter and because the body only
remains, the body and not the pradh&acirc;na of the
S&acirc;@nkhyas.&mdash;But here the following doubt arises: How can
the word 'undeveloped' appropriately denote the body which, as a
gross and clearly appearing thing, should rather be called vyakta,
i.e. that which is developed or manifested?</p>
<p>To this doubt the S&ucirc;tra replies that what the term avyakta
denotes is the subtle causal body. Anything subtle may be spoken of
as Undeveloped. The gross body indeed cannot directly be termed
'undeveloped,' but the subtle parts of the elements from which the
gross body originates may be called so, and that the term denoting
the causal substance is applied to the effect also is a matter of
common occurrence; compare, for instance, the phrase 'mix the Soma
with cows, i.e. milk' (<i>Ri</i>g-veda. S. IX, 46, 4). Another
scriptural passage also&mdash;'now all this was then undeveloped'
(B<i>ri</i>. Up. I, 4, 7)&mdash;shows that this, i.e. this
developed world with its distinction of names and forms, is capable
of being termed undeveloped in so far as in a former condition it
was in a merely seminal or potential state, devoid of the later
evolved distinctions of name and form.</p>
<p>3. (Such a previous seminal condition of the world may be
admitted) on account of its dependency on him (the Lord); (for such
an admission is) according to reason.</p>
<p>Here a new objection is raised.&mdash;If, the opponent says, in
order to prove the possibility of the body being called undeveloped
you admit that this world in its antecedent seminal condition
before either names or forms are evolved can be called undeveloped,
you virtually concede the doctrine that the pradh&acirc;na is the
cause of the world. For we S&acirc;@nkhyas understand by the term
pradh&acirc;na nothing but that antecedent condition of the
world.</p>
<p>Things lie differently, we rejoin. If we admitted some
antecedent state of the world as the independent cause of the
actual world, we should indeed implicitly, admit the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>{243}</span>
pradh&acirc;na doctrine. What we admit is, however, only a previous
state dependent on the highest Lord, not an independent state. A
previous stage of the world such as the one assumed by us must
necessarily be admitted, since it is according to sense and reason.
For without it the highest Lord could not be conceived as creator,
as he could not become active if he were destitute of the
potentiality of action. The existence of such a causal potentiality
renders it moreover possible that the released souls should not
enter on new courses of existence, as it is destroyed by perfect
knowledge. For that causal potentiality is of the nature of
Nescience; it is rightly denoted by the term 'undeveloped;' it has
the highest Lord for its substratum; it is of the nature of an
illusion; it is a universal sleep in which are lying the
transmigrating souls destitute for the time of the consciousness of
their individual character.<a id="footnotetag230" name=
"footnotetag230"></a><a href="#footnote230"><sup>230</sup></a> This
undeveloped principle is sometimes denoted by the term
&acirc;k&acirc;<i>s</i>a, ether; so, for instance, in the passage,
'In that Imperishable then, O G&acirc;rg&icirc;, the ether is woven
like warp and woof' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. III, 8, 11). Sometimes, again,
it is denoted by the term akshara, the Imperishable; so, for
instance (Mu. Up. II, 1, 2), 'Higher, than the high Imperishable.'
Sometimes it is spoken of as M&acirc;y&acirc;, illusion; so, for
instance (<i>S</i>ve. Up. IV, 10), 'Know then Prak<i>ri</i>ti is
M&acirc;y&acirc;, and the great Lord he who is affected with
M&acirc;y&acirc;.' For M&acirc;y&acirc; is properly called
undeveloped or non-manifested since it cannot be defined either as
that which is or that which is not.&mdash;The statement of the
K&acirc;<i>th</i>aka that 'the Undeveloped is beyond the Great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page244" id=
"page244"></a>{244}</span> one' is based on the fact of the Great
one originating from the Undeveloped, if the Great one be the
intellect of Hira<i>n</i>yagarbha. If, on the other hand, we
understand by the Great one the individual soul, the statement is
founded on the fact of the existence of the individual soul
depending on the Undeveloped, i.e. Nescience. For the continued
existence of the individual soul as such is altogether owing to the
relation in which it stands to Nescience. The quality of being
beyond the Great one which in the first place belongs to the
Undeveloped, i.e. Nescience, is attributed to the body which is the
product of Nescience, the cause and the effect being considered as
identical. Although the senses, &amp;c. are no less products of
Nescience, the term 'the Undeveloped' here refers to the body only,
the senses, &amp;c. having already been specially mentioned by
their individual names, and the body alone being left.&mdash;Other
interpreters of the two last S&ucirc;tras give a somewhat different
explanation<a id="footnotetag231" name=
"footnotetag231"></a><a href="#footnote231"><sup>231</sup></a>.&mdash;There
are, they say, two kinds of body, the gross one and the subtle one.
The gross body is the one which is perceived; the nature of the
subtle one will be explained later on. (Ved. S&ucirc;. III, 1, 1.)
Both these bodies together were in the simile compared to the
chariot; but here (in the passage under discussion) only the subtle
body is referred to as the Undeveloped, since the subtle body only
is capable of being denoted by that term. And as the soul's passing
through bondage and release depends on the subtle body, the latter
is said to be beyond the soul, like the things (arthavat), i.e.
just as the objects are said to be beyond the senses because the
activity of the latter depends on the objects.&mdash;But
how&mdash;we ask interpreters&mdash;is it possible that the word
'Undeveloped' should refer to the subtle body only, while,
according to your opinion, both bodies had in the simile been
represented as a chariot, and so equally constitute part of the
topic of the chapter, and equally remain (to be mentioned in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id=
"page245"></a>{245}</span> passage under discussion)?&mdash;If you
should rejoin that you are authorised to settle the meaning of what
the text actually mentions, but not to find fault with what is not
mentioned, and that the word avyakta which occurs in the text can
denote only the subtle body, but not the gross body which is
vyakta, i.e. developed or manifest; we invalidate this rejoinder by
remarking that the determination of the sense depends on the
circumstance of the passages interpreted constituting a syntactical
whole. For if the earlier and the later passage do not form a whole
they convey no sense, since that involves the abandonment of the
subject started and the taking up of a new subject. But syntactical
unity cannot be established unless it be on the ground of there
being a want of a complementary part of speech or sentence. If you
therefore construe the connexion of the passages without having
regard to the fact that the latter passage demands as its
complement that both bodies (which had been spoken of in the former
passage) should be understood as referred to, you destroy all
syntactical unity and so incapacitate yourselves from arriving at
the true meaning of the text. Nor must you think that the second
passage occupies itself with the subtle body only, for that reason
that the latter is not easily distinguished from the Self, while
the gross body is easily so distinguished on account of its readily
perceived loathsomeness. For the passage does not by any means
refer to such a distinction&mdash;as we conclude from the
circumstance of there being no verb enjoining it&mdash;but has for
its only subject the highest place of Vish<i>n</i>u, which had been
mentioned immediately before. For after having enumerated a series
of things in which the subsequent one is always superior to the one
preceding it, it concludes by saying that nothing is beyond the
Person.&mdash;We might, however, accept the interpretation just
discussed without damaging our general argumentation; for whichever
explanation we receive, so much remains clear that the
K&acirc;<i>th</i>aka passage does not refer to the
pradh&acirc;na.</p>
<p>4. And (the pradh&acirc;na cannot be meant) because <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>{246}</span> there is
no statement as to (the avyakta) being something to be
cognised.</p>
<p>The S&acirc;@nkhyas, moreover, represent the pradh&acirc;na as
something to be cognised in so far as they say that from the
knowledge of the difference of the constitutive elements of the
pradh&acirc;na and of the soul there results the desired isolation
of the soul. For without a knowledge of the nature of those
constitutive elements it is impossible to cognise the difference of
the soul from them. And somewhere they teach that the
pradh&acirc;na is to be cognised by him who wishes to attain
special powers.&mdash;Now in the passage under discussion the
avyakta is not mentioned as an object of knowledge; we there meet
with the mere word avyakta, and there is no sentence intimating
that the avyakta is to be known or meditated upon. And it is
impossible to maintain that a knowledge of things which (knowledge)
is not taught in the text is of any advantage to man.&mdash;For
this reason also we maintain that the word avyakta cannot denote
the pradh&acirc;na.&mdash;Our interpretation, on the other hand, is
unobjectionable, since according to it the passage mentions the
body (not as an object of knowledge, but merely) for the purpose of
throwing light on the highest place of Vish<i>n</i>u, in
continuation of the simile in which the body had been compared to a
chariot.</p>
<p>5. And if you maintain that the text does speak (of the
pradh&acirc;na as an object of knowledge) we deny that; for the
intelligent (highest) Self is meant, on account of the general
subject-matter.</p>
<p>Here the S&acirc;@nkhya raises a new objection, and maintains
that the averment made in the last S&ucirc;tra is not proved, since
the text later on speaks of the pradh&acirc;na&mdash;which had been
referred to as the Undeveloped&mdash;as an object of knowledge. 'He
who has perceived that which is without sound, without touch,
without form, without decay, without taste, eternal, without smell,
without beginning, without end, beyond the great and unchangeable,
is freed from the jaws of death' (Ka. Up. II, 3, 15). For here the
text speaks of the pradh&acirc;na, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page247" id="page247"></a>{247}</span> which is beyond the great,
describing it as possessing the same qualities which the
S&acirc;@nkhya-sm<i>ri</i>ti ascribes to it, and designating it as
the object of perception. Hence we conclude that the pradh&acirc;na
is denoted by the term avyakta.</p>
<p>To this we reply that the passage last quoted does represent as
the object of perception not the pradh&acirc;na but the
intelligent, i.e. the highest Self. We conclude this from the
general subject-matter. For that the highest Self continues to form
the subject-matter is clear from the following reasons. In the
first place, it is referred to in the passage, 'Beyond the person
there is nothing, this is the goal, the highest Road;' it has
further to be supplied as the object of knowledge in the passage,
'The Self is hidden in all beings and does not shine forth,'
because it is there spoken of as difficult to know; after that the
restraint of passion, &amp;c. is enjoined as conducive to its
cognition, in the passage, 'A wise man should keep down speech
within the mind;' and, finally, release from the jaws of death is
declared to be the fruit of its knowledge. The S&acirc;@nkhyas, on
the other hand, do not suppose that a man is freed from the jaws of
death merely by perceiving the pradh&acirc;na, but connect that
result rather with the cognition of the intelligent Self.&mdash;The
highest Self is, moreover, spoken of in all Ved&acirc;nta-texts as
possessing just those qualities which are mentioned in the passage
quoted above, viz. absence of sound, and the like. Hence it
follows, that the pradh&acirc;na is in the text neither spoken of
as the object of knowledge nor denoted by the term avyakta.</p>
<p>6. And there is question and explanation relative to three
things only (not to the pradh&acirc;na).</p>
<p>To the same conclusion we are led by the consideration of the
circumstance that the Ka<i>th</i>avall&icirc;-upanishad brings
forward, as subjects of discussion, only three things, viz. the
fire sacrifice, the individual soul, and the highest Self. These
three things only Yama explains, bestowing thereby the boons he had
granted, and to them only the questions of Na<i>k</i>iketas refer.
Nothing else is mentioned or enquired <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page248" id="page248"></a>{248}</span> about.
The question relative to the fire sacrifice is contained in the
passage (Ka. Up. I, 1, 13), 'Thou knowest, O Death, the fire
sacrifice which leads us to Heaven; tell it to me, who am full of
faith.' The question as to the individual soul is contained in I,
1, 20, 'There is that doubt when a man is dead, some saying, he is;
others, he is not. This I should like to know, taught by thee; this
is the third of my boons.' And the question about the highest Self
is asked in the passage (I, 2, 14), 'That which thou seest as
neither this nor that, as neither effect nor cause, as neither past
nor future, tell me that.'&mdash;The corresponding answers are
given in I, 1, 15, 'Yama then told him that fire sacrifice, the
beginning of all the worlds, and what bricks are required for the
altar, and how many;' in the passage met with considerably later on
(II, 5, 6; 7), 'Well then, O Gautama, I shall tell thee this
mystery, the old Brahman and what happens to the Self after
reaching death. Some enter the womb in order to have a body as
organic beings, others go into inorganic matter according to their
work and according to their knowledge;' and in the passage (I, 2,
18), 'The knowing Self is not born nor does it die,' &amp;c.; which
latter passage dilates at length on the highest Self. But there is
no question relative to the pradh&acirc;na, and hence no
opportunity for any remarks on it.</p>
<p>Here the S&acirc;@nkhya advances a new objection. Is, he asks,
the question relative to the Self which is asked in the passage,
'There is that doubt when a man is dead,' &amp;c., again resumed in
the passage, 'That which thou seest as neither this nor that,'
&amp;c, or does the latter passage raise a distinct new question?
If the former, the two questions about the Self coalesce into one,
and there are therefore altogether two questions only, one relative
to the fire sacrifice, the other relative to the Self. In that case
the S&ucirc;tra has no right to speak of questions and explanations
relating to three subjects.&mdash;If the latter, you do not
consider it a mistake to assume a question in excess of the number
of boons granted, and can therefore not object to us if we assume
an explanation about the pradh&acirc;na in excess of the number of
questions asked.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id=
"page249"></a>{249}</span>
<p>To this we make the following reply.&mdash;We by no means assume
a question in excess of the number of boons granted, being
prevented from doing so by the influence of the opening part of
that syntactical whole which constitutes the
Ka<i>th</i>avall&icirc;-upanishad. The Upanishad starts with the
topic of the boons granted by Yama, and all the following part of
the Upanishad&mdash;which is thrown into the form of a colloquy of
Yama and Na<i>k</i>iketas&mdash;carries on that topic up to the
very end. Yama grants to Na<i>k</i>iketas, who had been sent by his
father, three boons. For his first boon Na<i>k</i>iketas chooses
kindness on the part of his father towards him, for his second boon
the knowledge of the fire sacrifice, for his third boon the
knowledge of the Self. That the knowledge of the Self is the third
boon appears from the indication contained in the passage (I, 1,
20), 'There is that doubt&mdash;; this is the third of my
boons.'&mdash;If we therefore supposed that the passage, 'That
which thou seest as neither this nor that,' &amp;c., raises a new
question, we should thereby assume a question in excess of the
number of boons granted, and thus destroy the connexion of the
entire Upanishad.&mdash;But&mdash;the S&acirc;@nkhya will perhaps
interpose&mdash;it must needs be admitted that the passage last
quoted does raise a new question, because the subject enquired
about is a new one. For the former question refers to the
individual soul, as we conclude from the doubt expressed in the
words, 'There is that doubt when a man is dead&mdash;some saying,
he is; others, he is not.' Now this individual soul, as having
definite attributes, &amp;c., cannot constitute the object of a
question expressed in such terms as, 'This which thou seest as
neither this nor that,' &amp;c.; the highest Self, on the other
hand, may be enquired about in such terms, since it is above all
attributes. The appearance of the two questions is, moreover, seen
to differ; for the former question refers to existence and
non-existence, while the latter is concerned with an entity raised
above all definite attributes, &amp;c. Hence we conclude that the
latter question, in which the former one cannot be recognised, is a
separate question, and does not merely resume the subject of the
former one.&mdash;All this argumentation is not valid, we reply,
since we maintain the unity of the highest Self and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id=
"page250"></a>{250}</span> individual Self. If the individual Self
were different from the highest Self, we should have to declare
that the two questions are separate independent questions, but the
two are not really different, as we know from other scriptural
passages, such as 'Thou art that.' And in the Upanishad under
discussion also the answer to the question, 'That which thou seest
as neither this nor that,' viz. the passage, 'The knowing Self is
not born, it dies not'&mdash;which answer is given in the form of a
denial of the birth and death of the Self-clearly shows that the
embodied Self and the highest Self are non-different. For there is
room for a denial of something only when that something is
possible, and the possibility of birth and death exists in the
embodied Self only, since it is connected with the body, but not in
the highest Self.&mdash;There is, moreover, another passage
conveying the same meaning, viz. II, 4, 4, 'The wise when he knows
that that by which he perceives all objects in sleep or in waking,
is the great omnipresent Self, grieves no more.' This passage makes
the cessation of all grief dependent on the knowledge of the
individual Self, in so far as it possesses the qualities of
greatness and omnipresence, and thereby declares that the
individual Self is not different from the highest Self. For that
the cessation of all sorrow is consequent on the knowledge of the
highest Self, is a recognised Ved&acirc;nta tenet.&mdash;There is
another passage also warning men not to look on the individual Self
and the highest Self as different entities, viz. II, 4, 10, 'What
is here the same is there; and what is there the same is here. He
who sees any difference here goes from death to death.'&mdash;The
following circumstance, too, is worthy of consideration. When
Na<i>k</i>iketas has asked the question relating to the existence
or non-existence of the soul after death, Yama tries to induce him
to choose another boon, tempting him with the offer of various
objects of desire. But Na<i>k</i>iketas remains firm. Thereupon
Death, dwelling on the distinction of the Good and the Pleasant,
and the distinction of wisdom and ignorance, praises
Na<i>k</i>iketas, 'I believe Na<i>k</i>iketas to be one who desires
knowledge, for even many pleasures did not tear thee away' (I, 2,
4); and later on praises the question <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251"></a>{251}</span> asked by
Na<i>k</i>iketas, 'The wise who, by means of meditation on his
Self, recognises the Ancient who is difficult to be seen, who has
entered into the dark, who is hidden in the cave, who dwells in the
abyss, as God, he indeed leaves joy and sorrow far behind' (I, 2,
12). Now all this means to intimate that the individual Self and
the highest Self are non-different. For if Na<i>k</i>iketas set
aside the question, by asking which he had earned for himself the
praise of Yama, and after having received that praise asked a new
question, all that praise would have been bestowed on him unduly.
Hence it follows that the question implied in I, 2, 14, 'That which
thou seest as neither this nor that,' merely resumes the topic to
which the question in I, 1, 20 had referred.&mdash;Nor is there any
basis to the objection that the two questions differ in form. The
second question, in reality, is concerned with the same distinction
as the first. The first enquires about the existence of the soul
apart from the body, &amp;c.; the second refers to the circumstance
of that soul not being subject to sa<i>m</i>s&acirc;ra. For as long
as Nescience remains, so long the soul is affected with definite
attributes, &amp;c.; but as soon as Nescience comes to an end, the
soul is one with the highest Self, as is taught by such scriptural
texts as 'Thou art that.' But whether Nescience be active or
inactive, no difference is made thereby in the thing itself (viz.
the soul). A man may, in the dark, mistake a piece of rope lying on
the ground for a snake, and run away from it, frightened and
trembling; thereon another man may tell him, 'Do not be afraid, it
is only a rope, not a snake;' and he may then dismiss the fear
caused by the imagined snake, and stop running. But all the while
the presence and subsequent absence of his erroneous notion, as to
the rope being a snake, make no difference whatever in the rope
itself. Exactly analogous is the case of the individual soul which
is in reality one with the highest soul, although Nescience makes
it appear different. Hence the reply contained in the passage, 'It
is not born, it dies not,' is also to be considered as furnishing
an answer to the question asked in I, 1, 20.&mdash;The S&ucirc;tra
is to be understood with reference to the distinction of the
individual Self and the highest Self which <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>{252}</span> results
from Nescience. Although the question relating to the Self is in
reality one only, yet its former part (I, 1, 20) is seen specially
to refer to the individual Self, since there a doubt is set forth
as to the existence of the soul when, at the time of death, it
frees itself from the body, and since the specific marks of the
sa<i>m</i>s&acirc;ra-state, such as activity, &amp;c. are not
denied; while the latter part of the question (I, 2, 14), where the
state of being beyond all attributes is spoken of, clearly refers
to the highest Self.&mdash;For these reasons the S&ucirc;tra is
right in assuming three topics of question and explanation, viz.
the fire sacrifice, the individual soul, and the highest Self.
Those, on the other hand, who assume that the pradh&acirc;na
constitutes a fourth subject discussed in the Upanishad, can point
neither to a boon connected with it, nor to a question, nor to an
answer. Hence the pradh&acirc;na hypothesis is clearly inferior to
our own.</p>
<p>7. And (the case of the term avyakta) is like that of the term
mahat.</p>
<p>While the S&acirc;@nkhyas employ the term 'the Great one,' to
denote the first-born entity, which is mere existence<a id=
"footnotetag232" name="footnotetag232"></a><a href=
"#footnote232"><sup>232</sup></a> (? viz. the intellect), the term
has a different meaning in Vedic use. This we see from its being
connected with the Self, &amp;c. in such passages as the following,
'The great Self is beyond the Intellect' (Ka. Up. I, 3, 10); 'The
great omnipresent Self' (Ka. Up. I, 2, 23); 'I know that great
person' (<i>S</i>ve. Up. III, 8). We thence conclude that the word
avyakta also, where it occurs in the Veda, cannot denote the
pradh&acirc;na.&mdash;The pradh&acirc;na is therefore a mere thing
of inference, and not vouched for by Scripture.</p>
<p>8. (It cannot be maintained that aj&acirc; means the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page253" id=
"page253"></a>{253}</span> pradh&acirc;na) because no special
characteristic is stated; as in the case of the cup.</p>
<p>Here the advocate of the pradh&acirc;na comes again forward and
maintains that the absence of scriptural authority for the
pradh&acirc;na is not yet proved. For, he says, we have the
following mantra (<i>S</i>ve. Up. IV, 5), 'There is one
aj&acirc;<a id="footnotetag233" name="footnotetag233"></a><a href=
"#footnote233"><sup>233</sup></a>, red, white, and black, producing
manifold offspring of the same nature. There is one aja who loves
her and lies by her; there is another who leaves her after having
enjoyed her.'&mdash;In this mantra the words 'red,' 'white,' and
'black' denote the three constituent elements of the
pradh&acirc;na. Passion is called red on account of its colouring,
i.e. influencing property; Goodness is called white, because it is
of the nature of Light; Darkness is called black on account of its
covering and obscuring property. The state of equipoise of the
three constituent elements, i.e. the pradh&acirc;na, is denoted by
the attributes of its parts, and is therefore called
red-white-black. It is further called aj&acirc;, i.e. unborn,
because it is acknowledged to be the fundamental matter out of
which everything springs, not a mere effect.&mdash;But has not the
word aj&acirc; the settled meaning of she-goat?&mdash;True; but the
ordinary meaning of the word cannot be accepted in this place,
because true knowledge forms the general subject-matter.&mdash;That
pradh&acirc;na produces many creatures participating in its three
constituent elements. One unborn being loves her and lies by her,
i.e. some souls, deluded by ignorance, approach her, and falsely
imagining that they experience pleasure or pain, or are in a state
of dulness, pass through the course of transmigratory existence.
Other souls, again, which have attained to discriminative
knowledge, lose their attachment to prak<i>ri</i>ti, and leave her
after having enjoyed her, i.e. after she has afforded to them
enjoyment and release.&mdash;On the ground of this passage, as
interpreted above, the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page254" id=
"page254"></a>{254}</span> followers of Kapila claim the authority
of Scripture for their pradh&acirc;na hypothesis.</p>
<p>To this argumentation we reply, that the quoted mantra by no
means proves the S&acirc;@nkhya doctrine to be based on Scripture.
That mantra, taken by itself, is not able to give additional
strength to any doctrine. For, by means of some supposition or
other, the terms aj&acirc;, &amp;c. can be reconciled with any
doctrine, and there is no reason for the special assertion that the
S&acirc;@nkhya doctrine only is meant. The case is analogous to
that of the cup mentioned in the mantra, 'There is a cup having its
mouth below and its bottom above' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. II, 2, 3). Just
as it is impossible to decide on the ground of this mantra taken by
itself what special cup is meant&mdash;it being possible to
ascribe, somehow or other, the quality of the mouth being turned
downward to any cup&mdash;so here also there is no special quality
stated, so that it is not possible to decide from the mantra itself
whether the pradh&acirc;na is meant by the term aj&acirc;, or
something else.&mdash;But in connexion with the mantra about the
cup we have a supplementary passage from which we learn what kind
of cup is meant, 'What is called the cup having its mouth below and
its bottom above is this head.'&mdash;Whence, however, can we learn
what special being is meant by the aj&acirc; of the
<i>S</i>vet&acirc;<i>s</i>vatara-upanishad?&mdash;To this question
the next S&ucirc;tra replies.</p>
<p>9. But the (elements) beginning with light (are meant by the
term aj&acirc;); for some read so in their text.</p>
<p>By the term aj&acirc; we have to understand the causal matter of
the four classes of beings, which matter has sprung from the
highest Lord and begins with light, i.e. comprises fire, water, and
earth.&mdash;The word 'but' (in the S&ucirc;tra) gives emphasis to
the assertion.&mdash;This aj&acirc; is to be considered as
comprising three elementary substances, not as consisting of three
gu<i>n</i>as in the S&acirc;@nkhya sense. We draw this conclusion
from the fact that one <i>s</i>&acirc;kh&acirc;, after having
related how fire, water, and earth sprang from the highest Lord,
assigns to them red colour, and so on. 'The red colour of burning
fire <span class="pagenum"><a name="page255" id=
"page255"></a>{255}</span> (agni) is the colour of the elementary
fire (tejas), its white colour is the colour of water, its black
colour the colour of earth,' &amp;c. Now those three
elements&mdash;fire, water, and earth&mdash;we recognise in the
<i>S</i>vet&acirc;<i>s</i>vatara passage, as the words red, white,
and black are common to both passages, and as these words primarily
denote special colours and can be applied to the S&acirc;@nkhya
gu<i>n</i>as in a secondary sense only. That passages whose sense
is beyond doubt are to be used for the interpretation of doubtful
passages, is a generally acknowledged rule. As we therefore find
that in the <i>S</i>vet&acirc;<i>s</i>vatara&mdash;after the
general topic has been started in I, 1, 'The Brahman-students say,
Is Brahman the cause?'&mdash;the text, previous to the passage
under discussion, speaks of a power of the highest Lord which
arranges the whole world ('the Sages devoted to meditation and
concentration have seen the power belonging to God himself, hidden
in its own qualities'); and as further that same power is referred
to in two subsequent complementary passages ('Know then,
Prak<i>ri</i>ti is M&acirc;y&acirc;, and the great Lord he who is
affected with M&acirc;y&acirc;;' 'who being one only rules over
every germ;' IV, 10, 11); it cannot possibly be asserted that the
mantra treating of the aj&acirc; refers to some independent causal
matter called pradh&acirc;na. We rather assert, on the ground of
the general subject-matter, that the mantra describes the same
divine power referred to in the other passages, in which names and
forms lie unevolved, and which we assume as the antecedent
condition of that state of the world in which names and forms are
evolved. And that divine power is represented as three-coloured,
because its products, viz. fire, water, and earth, have three
distinct colours.&mdash;But how can we maintain, on the ground of
fire, water, and earth having three colours, that the causal matter
is appropriately called a three-coloured aj&acirc;? if we consider,
on the one hand, that the exterior form of the genus aj&acirc;
(i.e. goat) does not inhere in fire, water, and earth; and, on the
other hand, that Scripture teaches fire, water, and earth to have
been produced, so that the word aj&acirc; cannot be taken in the
sense 'non-produced<a id="footnotetag234" name=
"footnotetag234"></a><a href=
"#footnote234"><sup>234</sup></a>.'&mdash;To this question the next
S&ucirc;tra replies.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id=
"page256"></a>{256}</span>
<p>10. And on account of the statement of the assumption (of a
metaphor) there is nothing contrary to reason (in aj&acirc;
denoting the causal matter); just as in the case of honey (denoting
the sun) and similar cases.</p>
<p>The word aj&acirc; neither expresses that fire, water, and earth
belong to the goat species, nor is it to be explained as meaning
'unborn;' it rather expresses an assumption, i.e. it intimates the
assumption of the source of all beings (which source comprises
fire, water, and earth), being compared to a she-goat. For as
accidentally some she-goat might be partly red, partly white,
partly black, and might have many young goats resembling her in
colour, and as some he-goat might love her and lie by her, while
some other he-goat might leave her after having enjoyed her; so the
universal causal matter which is tri-coloured, because comprising
fire, water, and earth, produces many inanimate and animate beings
similar to itself, and is enjoyed by the souls fettered by
Nescience, while it is abandoned by those souls which have attained
true knowledge.&mdash;Nor must we imagine that the distinction of
individual souls, which is implied in the preceding explanation,
involves that reality of the multiplicity of souls which forms one
of the tenets of other philosophical schools. For the purport of
the passage is to intimate, not the multiplicity of souls, but the
distinction of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page257" id=
"page257"></a>{257}</span> the states of bondage and release. This
latter distinction is explained with reference to the multiplicity
of souls as ordinarily conceived; that multiplicity, however,
depends altogether on limiting adjuncts, and is the unreal product
of wrong knowledge merely; as we know from scriptural passages such
as, 'He is the one God hidden in all beings, all-pervading, the
Self in all beings,' &amp;c.&mdash;The words 'like the honey' (in
the S&ucirc;tra) mean that just as the sun, although not being
honey, is represented as honey (Ch. Up. III, 1), and speech as a
cow (B<i>ri</i>. Up. V, 8), and the heavenly world, &amp;c. as the
fires (B<i>ri</i>. Up. VI, 2, 9), so here the causal matter,
although not being a she-goat, is metaphorically represented as
one. There is therefore nothing contrary to reason in the
circumstance of the term aj&acirc; being used to denote the
aggregate of fire, water, and earth.</p>
<p>11. (The assertion that there is scriptural authority for the
pradh&acirc;na, &amp;c. can) also not (be based) on the mention of
the number (of the Sankhya categories), on account of the diversity
(of the categories) and on account of the excess (over the number
of those categories).</p>
<p>The attempt to base the S&acirc;@nkhya doctrine on the mantra
speaking of the aj&acirc; having failed, the S&acirc;@nkhya again
comes forward and points to another mantra: 'He in whom the five
"five-people" and the ether rest, him alone I believe to be the
Self; I who know believe him to be Brahman' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. IV, 4,
17). In this mantra we have one word which expresses the number
five, viz. the five-people, and then another word, viz. five, which
qualifies the former; these two words together therefore convey the
idea of five pentads, i.e. twenty-five. Now as many beings as the
number twenty-five presupposes, just so many categories the
S&acirc;nkhya system counts. Cp. S&acirc;@nkhya K&acirc;rik&acirc;,
3: 'The fundamental causal substance (i.e. the pradh&acirc;na) is
not an effect. Seven (substances), viz. the Great one (Intellect),
and so on, are causal substances as well as effects. Sixteen are
effects. The soul is neither a causal substance nor an effect.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page258" id=
"page258"></a>{258}</span> As therefore the number twenty-five,
which occurs in the scriptural passage quoted, clearly refers to
the twenty-five categories taught in the
S&acirc;@nkhya-sm<i>ri</i>ti, it follows that the doctrine of the
pradh&acirc;na, &amp;c. rests on a scriptural basis.</p>
<p>To this reasoning we make the following reply.&mdash;It is
impossible to base the assertion that the pradh&acirc;na, &amp;c.
have Scripture in their favour on the reference to their number
which you pretend to find in the text, 'on account of the diversity
of the S&acirc;@nkhya categories.' The S&acirc;@nkhya categories
have each their individual difference, and there are no attributes
belonging in common to each pentad on account of which the number
twenty-five could be divided into five times five. For a number of
individually separate things can, in general, not be combined into
smaller groups of two or three, &amp;c. unless there be a special
reason for such combination.&mdash;Here the S&acirc;@nkhya will
perhaps rejoin that the expression five (times) five is used only
to denote the number twenty-five which has five pentads for its
constituent parts; just as the poem says, 'five years and seven
Indra did not rain,' meaning only that there was no rain for twelve
years.&mdash;But this explanation also is not tenable. In the first
place, it is liable to the objection that it has recourse to
indirect indication.<a id="footnotetag235" name=
"footnotetag235"></a><a href="#footnote235"><sup>235</sup></a> In
the second place, the second 'five' constitutes a compound with the
word 'people,' the br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a-accent showing that the
two form one word only.<a id="footnotetag236" name=
"footnotetag236"></a><a href="#footnote236"><sup>236</sup></a> To
the same conclusion we are led by another passage also (Taitt.
Sa<i>m</i>h. I, 6, 2, 2, pa<i>&ntilde;k</i>&acirc;n&acirc;<i>m</i>
tv&acirc; pa<i>&ntilde;k</i>ajan&acirc;n&acirc;m, &amp;c.) where
the two terms constitute one word, have one accent and one
case-termination. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id=
"page259"></a>{259}</span> The word thus being a compound there is
neither a repetition of the word 'five,' involving two pentads, nor
does the one five qualify the other, as the mere secondary member
of a compound cannot be qualified by another word.&mdash;But as the
people are already denoted to be five by the compound
'five-people,' the effect of the other 'five' qualifying the
compound will be that we understand twenty-five people to be meant;
just as the expression 'five five-bundles' (pa<i>&ntilde;k</i>a
pa<i>&ntilde;k</i>apulya<i>h</i>) conveys the idea of twenty-five
bundles.&mdash;The instance is not an analogous one, we reply. The
word 'pa<i>&ntilde;k</i>ap&ucirc;li' denotes a unity (i.e. one
bundle made up of five bundles) and hence when the question arises,
'How many such bundles are there?' it can be qualified by the word
'five,' indicating that there are five such bundles. The word
pa<i>&ntilde;k</i>ajan&acirc;<i>h</i>, on the other hand, conveys
at once the idea of distinction (i.e. of five distinct things), so
that there is no room at all for a further desire to know how many
people there are, and hence no room for a further qualification.
And if the word 'five' be taken as a qualifying word it can only
qualify the numeral five (in five-people); the objection against
which assumption has already been stated.&mdash;For all these
reasons the expression the five five-people cannot denote the
twenty-five categories of the S&acirc;@nkhyas.&mdash;This is
further not possible 'on account of the excess.' For on the
S&acirc;@nkhya interpretation there would be an excess over the
number twenty-five, owing to the circumstance of the ether and the
Self being mentioned separately. The Self is spoken of as the abode
in which the five five-people rest, the clause 'Him I believe to be
the Self' being connected with the 'in whom' of the antecedent
clause. Now the Self is the intelligent soul of the S&acirc;@nkhyas
which is already included in the twenty-five categories, and which
therefore, on their interpretation of the passage, would here be
mentioned once as constituting the abode and once as what rests in
the abode! If, on the other hand, the soul were supposed not to be
compiled in the twenty-five categories, the S&acirc;@nkhya would
thereby abandon his own doctrine of the categories being
twenty-five. The same <span class="pagenum"><a name="page260" id=
"page260"></a>{260}</span> remarks apply to the separate mention
made of the ether.&mdash;How, finally, can the mere circumstance of
a certain number being referred to in the sacred text justify the
assumption that what is meant are the twenty-five S&acirc;@nkhya
categories of which Scripture speaks in no other place? especially
if we consider that the word jana has not the settled meaning of
category, and that the number may be satisfactorily accounted for
on another interpretation of the passage.</p>
<p>How, then, the S&acirc;@nkhya will ask, do you interpret the
phrase 'the five five-people?'&mdash;On the ground, we reply, of
the rule P&acirc;<i>n</i>ini II, 1, 50, according to which certain
compounds formed with numerals are mere names. The word
pa<i>&ntilde;k</i>ajan&acirc;<i>h</i> thus is not meant to convey
the idea of the number five, but merely to denote certain classes
of beings. Hence the question may present itself, How many such
classes are there? and to this question an answer is given by the
added numeral 'five.' There are certain classes of beings called
five-people, and these classes are five. Analogously we may speak
of the seven seven-<i>ri</i>shis, where again the compound denotes
a class of beings merely, not their number.&mdash;Who then are
those five-people?&mdash;To this question the next S&ucirc;tra
replies.</p>
<p>12. (The pa<i>&ntilde;k</i>ajan&acirc;<i>h</i> are) the breath
and so on, (as is seen) from the complementary passage.</p>
<p>The mantra in which the pa<i>&ntilde;k</i>ajan&acirc;<i>h</i>
are mentioned is followed by another one in which breath and four
other things are mentioned for the purpose of describing the nature
of Brahman. 'They who know the breath of breath, the eye of the
eye, the ear of the ear, the food of food, the mind of mind<a id=
"footnotetag237" name="footnotetag237"></a><a href=
"#footnote237"><sup>237</sup></a>.' Hence we conclude, on the
ground of proximity, that the five-people are the beings mentioned
in this latter mantra.&mdash;But how, the S&acirc;@nkhya asks, can
the word 'people' be applied to the breath, the eye, the ear, and
so on?&mdash;How, we ask in return, can it be <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page261" id="page261"></a>{261}</span> applied
to your categories? In both cases the common meaning of the word
'people' has to be disregarded; but in favour of our explanation is
the fact that the breath, the eye, and so on, are mentioned in a
complementary passage. The breath, the eye, &amp;c. may be denoted
by the word 'people' because they are connected with people.
Moreover, we find the word 'person,' which means as much as
'people,' applied to the pr&acirc;<i>n</i>as in the passage, 'These
are the five persons of Brahman' (Ch. Up. III, 13, 6); and another
passage runs, 'Breath is father, breath is mother,' &amp;c. (Ch.
Up. VII, 15, 1). And, owing to the force of composition, there is
no objection to the compound being taken in its settled
conventional meaning<a id="footnotetag238" name=
"footnotetag238"></a><a href=
"#footnote238"><sup>238</sup></a>.&mdash;But how can the
conventional meaning be had recourse to, if there is no previous
use of the word in that meaning?&mdash;That may be done, we reply,
just as in the case of udbhid and similar words<a id=
"footnotetag239" name="footnotetag239"></a><a href=
"#footnote239"><sup>239</sup></a>. We often infer that a word of
unknown meaning refers to some known thing because it is used in
connexion with the latter. So, for instance, in the case of the
following words: 'He is to sacrifice with the udbhid; he cuts the
y&ucirc;pa; he makes the vedi.' Analogously we conclude that the
term pa<i>&ntilde;k</i>ajan&acirc;<i>h</i>, which, from the
grammatical rule quoted, is known to be a name, and which therefore
demands a thing of which it is the name, denotes the breath, the
eye, and so on, which are connected with it through their being
mentioned in a complementary passage.&mdash;Some commentators
explain the word pa<i>&ntilde;k</i>ajan&acirc;<i>h</i> <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page262" id="page262"></a>{262}</span> to mean
the Gods, the Fathers, the Gandharvas, the Asuras, and the Rakshas.
Others, again, think that the four castes together with the
Nish&acirc;das are meant. Again, some scriptural passage
(<i>Ri</i>g-veda Sa<i>m</i>h. VIII, 53, 7) speaks of the tribe of
'the five-people,' meaning thereby the created beings in general;
and this latter explanation also might be applied to the passage
under discussion. The teacher (the S&ucirc;trak&acirc;ra), on the
other hand, aiming at showing that the passage does not refer to
the twenty-five categories of the S&acirc;@nkhyas, declares that on
the ground of the complementary passage breath, &amp;c. have to be
understood.</p>
<p>Well, let it then be granted that the five-people mentioned in
the M&acirc;dhyandina-text are breath, &amp;c. since that text
mentions food also (and so makes up the number five). But how shall
we interpret the K&acirc;<i>n</i>va-text which does not mention
food (and thus altogether speaks of four things only)?&mdash;To
this question the next S&ucirc;tra replies.</p>
<p>13. In the case of (the text of) some (the K&acirc;<i>n</i>vas)
where food is not mentioned, (the number five is made full) by the
light (mentioned in the preceding mantra).</p>
<p>The K&acirc;<i>n</i>va-text, although not mentioning food, makes
up the full number five, by the light mentioned in the mantra
preceding that in which the five-people are spoken of. That mantra
describes the nature of Brahman by saying, 'Him the gods worship as
the light of lights.'&mdash;If it be asked how it is accounted for
that the light mentioned in both texts equally is in one text to be
employed for the explanation of the five-people, and not in the
other text; we reply that the reason lies in the difference of the
requirements. As the M&acirc;dhyandinas meet in one and the same
mantra with breath and four other entities enabling them to
interpret the term, 'the five-people,' they are in no need of the
light mentioned in another mantra. The K&acirc;<i>n</i>vas, on the
other hand, cannot do without the light. The case is analogous to
that of the Sho<i>d</i>a<i>s</i>in-cup, which, according to
different <span class="pagenum"><a name="page263" id=
"page263"></a>{263}</span> passages, is either to be offered or not
to be offered at the atir&acirc;tra-sacrifice.</p>
<p>We have proved herewith that Scripture offers no basis for the
doctrine of the pradh&acirc;na. That this doctrine cannot be proved
either by Sm<i>ri</i>ti or by ratiocination will be shown later
on.</p>
<p>14. (Although there is a conflict of the Ved&acirc;nta-passages
with regard to the things created, such as) ether and so on; (there
is no such conflict with regard to the Lord) on account of his
being represented (in one passage) as described (in other
passages), viz. as the cause (of the world).</p>
<p>In the preceding part of the work the right definition of
Brahman has been established; it has been shown that all the
Ved&acirc;nta-texts have Brahman for their common topic; and it has
been proved that there is no scriptural authority for the doctrine
of the pradh&acirc;na.&mdash;But now a new objection presents
itself.</p>
<p>It is not possible&mdash;our opponent says&mdash;to prove either
that Brahman is the cause of the origin, &amp;c. of the world, or
that all Ved&acirc;nta-texts refer to Brahman; because we observe
that the Ved&acirc;nta-texts contradict one another. All the
Ved&acirc;nta-passages which treat of the creation enumerate its
successive steps in different order, and so in reality speak of
different creations. In one place it is said that from the Self
there sprang the ether (Taitt. Up. II, 1); in another place that
the creation began with fire (Ch. Up. VI, 2, 3); in another place,
again, that the Person created breath and from breath faith (Pr.
Up. VI, 4); in another place, again, that the Self created these
worlds, the water (above the heaven), light, the mortal (earth),
and the water (below the earth) (Ait. &Acirc;r. II, 4, 1, 2; 3).
There no order is stated at all. Somewhere else it is said that the
creation originated from the Non-existent. 'In the beginning this
was non-existent; from it was born what exists' (Taitt. Up. II, 7);
and, 'In the beginning this was non-existent; it became existent;
it grew' (Ch. Up. III, 19, 1). In another place, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page264" id="page264"></a>{264}</span> again,
the doctrine of the Non-existent being the antecedent of the
creation is impugned, and the Existent mentioned in its stead.
'Others say, in the beginning there was that only which is not; but
how could it be thus, my dear? How could that which is be born of
that which is not?' (Ch. Up. VI, 2, 1; 2.) And in another place,
again, the development of the world is spoken of as having taken
place spontaneously, 'Now all this was then undeveloped. It became
developed by form and name' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. I, 4, 7).&mdash;As
therefore manifold discrepancies are observed, and as no option is
possible in the case of an accomplished matter<a id=
"footnotetag240" name="footnotetag240"></a><a href=
"#footnote240"><sup>240</sup></a>, the Ved&acirc;nta-passages
cannot be accepted as authorities for determining the cause of the
world, but we must rather accept some other cause of the world
resting on the authority of Sm<i>ri</i>ti and Reasoning.</p>
<p>To this we make the following reply.&mdash;Although the
Ved&acirc;nta-passages may be conflicting with regard to the order
of the things created, such as ether and so on, they do not
conflict with regard to the creator, 'on account of his being
represented as described.' That means: such as the creator is
described in any one Ved&acirc;nta-passage, viz. as all-knowing,
the Lord of all, the Self of all, without a second, so he is
represented in all other Ved&acirc;nta-passages also. Let us
consider, for instance, the description of Brahman (given in Taitt.
Up. II, 1 ff.). There it is said at first, 'Truth, knowledge,
infinite is Brahman.' Here the word 'knowledge,' and so likewise
the statement, made later on, that Brahman desired (II, 6),
intimate that Brahman is of the nature of intelligence. Further,
the text declares<a id="footnotetag241" name=
"footnotetag241"></a><a href="#footnote241"><sup>241</sup></a> that
the cause of the world is the general Lord, by representing it as
not dependent on anything else. It further applies to the cause of
the world the term 'Self' (II, 1), and it represents it as abiding
within the series of sheaths beginning <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page265" id="page265"></a>{265}</span> with the
gross body; whereby it affirms it to be the internal Self within
all beings. Again&mdash;in the passage, 'May I be many, may I grow
forth'&mdash;it tells how the Self became many, and thereby
declares that the creator is non-different from the created
effects. And&mdash;in the passage, 'He created all this whatever
there is'&mdash;it represents the creator as the Cause of the
entire world, and thereby declares him to have been without a
second previously to the creation. The same characteristics which
in the above passages are predicated of Brahman, viewed as the
Cause of the world, we find to be predicated of it in other
passages also, so, for instance, 'Being only, my dear, was this in
the beginning, one only, without a second. It thought, may I be
many, may I grow forth. It sent forth fire' (Ch. Up. VI, 2, 1; 3),
and 'In the beginning all this was Self, one only; there was
nothing else blinking whatsoever. He thought, shall I send forth
worlds?' (Ait. &Acirc;r. II, 4, 1, 1; 2.) The
Ved&acirc;nta-passages which are concerned with setting forth the
cause of the world are thus in harmony throughout.&mdash;On the
other hand, there are found conflicting statements concerning the
world, the creation being in some places said to begin with ether,
in other places with fire, and so on. But, in the first place, it
cannot be said that the conflict of statements concerning the world
affects the statements concerning the cause, i.e. Brahman, in which
all the Ved&acirc;nta-texts are seen to agree&mdash;for that would
be an altogether unfounded generalization;&mdash;and, in the second
place, the teacher will reconcile later on (II, 3) those
conflicting passages also which refer to the world. And, to
consider the matter more thoroughly, a conflict of statements
regarding the world would not even matter greatly, since the
creation of the world and similar topics are not at all what
Scripture wishes to teach. For we neither observe nor are told by
Scripture that the welfare of man depends on those matters in any
way; nor have we the right to assume such a thing; because we
conclude from the introductory and concluding clauses that the
passages about the creation and the like form only subordinate
members of passages treating of Brahman. That all the passages
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page266" id=
"page266"></a>{266}</span> setting forth the creation and so on
subserve the purpose of teaching Brahman, Scripture itself
declares; compare Ch. Up. VI, 8, 4, 'As food too is an offshoot,
seek after its root, viz. water. And as water too is an offshoot,
seek after its root, viz. fire. And as fire too is an offshoot,
seek after its root, viz. the True.' We, moreover, understand that
by means of comparisons such as that of the clay (Ch. Up. VI, 1, 4)
the creation is described merely for the purpose of teaching us
that the effect is not really different from the cause. Analogously
it is said by those who know the sacred tradition, 'If creation is
represented by means of (the similes of) clay, iron, sparks, and
other things; that is only a means for making it understood that
(in reality) there is no difference whatever' (Gau<i>d</i>ap.
K&acirc;. III, 15).&mdash;On the other hand, Scripture expressly
states the fruits connected with the knowledge of Brahman, 'He who
knows Brahman obtains the highest' (Taitt. Up. II, 1); 'He who
knows the Self overcomes grief' (Ch. Up. VII, 1, 3); 'A man who
knows him passes over death' (<i>S</i>ve. Up. III, 8). That fruit
is, moreover, apprehended by intuition (pratyaksha), for as soon
as, by means of the doctrine, 'That art thou,' a man has arrived at
the knowledge that the Self is non-transmigrating, its
transmigrating nature vanishes for him.</p>
<p>It remains to dispose of the assertion that passages such as
'Non-being this was in the beginning' contain conflicting
statements about the nature of the cause. This is done in the next
S&ucirc;tra.</p>
<p>15. On account of the connexion (with passages treating of
Brahman, the passages speaking of the Non-being do not intimate
absolute Non-existence).</p>
<p>The passage 'Non-being indeed was this in the beginning' (Taitt.
Up. II, 7) does not declare that the cause of the world is the
absolutely Non-existent which is devoid of all Selfhood. For in the
preceding sections of the Upanishad Brahman is distinctly denied to
be the Non-existing, and is defined to be that which is ('He who
knows the Brahman as non-existing becomes himself non-existing.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page267" id=
"page267"></a>{267}</span> He who knows the Brahman as existing him
we know himself as existing'); it is further, by means of the
series of sheaths, viz. the sheath of food, &amp;c., represented as
the inner Self of everything. This same Brahman is again referred
to in the clause, 'He wished, may I be many;' is declared to have
originated the entire creation; and is finally referred to in the
clause, 'Therefore the wise call it the true.' Thereupon the text
goes on to say, with reference to what has all along been the topic
of discussion, 'On this there is also this <i>s</i>loka, Non-being
indeed was this in the beginning,' &amp;c.&mdash;If here the term
'Non-being' denoted the absolutely Non-existent, the whole context
would be broken; for while ostensibly referring to one matter the
passage would in reality treat of a second altogether different
matter. We have therefore to conclude that, while the term 'Being'
ordinarily denotes that which is differentiated by names and forms,
the term 'Non-being' denotes the same substance previous to its
differentiation, i.e. that Brahman is, in a secondary sense of the
word, called Non-being, previously to the origination of the world.
The same interpretation has to be applied to the passage 'Non-being
this was in the beginning' (Ch. Up. III, 19, 1); for that passage
also is connected with another passage which runs, 'It became
being;' whence it is evident that the 'Non-being' of the former
passage cannot mean absolute Non-existence. And in the passage,
'Others say, Non-being this was in the beginning' (Ch. Up. VI, 2,
1), the reference to the opinion of 'others' does not mean that the
doctrine referred, to (according to which the world was originally
absolutely non-existent) is propounded somewhere in the Veda; for
option is possible in the case of actions but not in the case of
substances. The passage has therefore to be looked upon as a
refutation of the tenet of primitive absolute non-existence as
fancifully propounded by some teachers of inferior intelligence; a
refutation undertaken for the purpose of strengthening the doctrine
that this world has sprung from that which is.&mdash;The following
passage again, 'Now this was then undeveloped,' &amp;c.
(B<i>ri</i>. Up. I, 4, 7), does not by any means assert that the
evolution of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page268" id=
"page268"></a>{268}</span> the world took place without a ruler; as
we conclude from the circumstance of its being connected with
another passage in which the ruler is represented as entering into
the evolved world of effects, 'He entered thither to the very tips
of the finger-nails' &amp;c. If it were supposed that the evolution
of the world takes place without a ruler, to whom could the
subsequent pronoun 'he' refer (in the passage last quoted) which
manifestly is to be connected with something previously intimated?
And as Scripture declares that the Self, after having entered into
the body, is of the nature of intelligence ('when seeing, eye by
name; when hearing, ear by name; when thinking, mind by name'), it
follows that it is intelligent at the time of its entering
also.&mdash;We, moreover, must assume that the world was evolved at
the beginning of the creation in the same way as it is at present
seen to develop itself by names and forms, viz. under the rulership
of an intelligent creator; for we have no right to make assumptions
contrary to what is at present actually observed. Another
scriptural passage also declares that the evolution of the world
took place under the superintendence of a ruler, 'Let me now enter
these beings with this living Self, and let me then evolve names
and forms' (Ch. Up. VI, 3, 2). The intransitive expression 'It
developed itself' (vy&acirc;kriyata; it became developed) is to be
viewed as having reference to the ease with which the real agent,
viz. the Lord, brought about that evolution. Analogously it is
said, for instance, that 'the cornfield reaps itself' (i.e. is
reaped with the greatest ease), although there is the reaper
sufficient (to account for the work being done).&mdash;Or else we
may look on the form vy&acirc;kriyata as having reference to a
necessarily implied agent; as is the case in such phrases as 'the
village is being approached' (where we necessarily have to supply
'by Devadatta or somebody else').</p>
<p>16. (He whose work is this is Brahman), because (the 'work')
denotes the world.</p>
<p>In the Kaush&icirc;taki-br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a, in the dialogue
of B&acirc;l&acirc;ki and Aj&agrave;ta<i>s</i>atru, we read, 'O
B&acirc;l&acirc;ki, he who is the maker of <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page269" id="page269"></a>{269}</span> those
persons, he of whom this is the work, he alone is to be known'
(Kau. Up. IV, 19). The question here arises whether what is here
inculcated as the object of knowledge is the individual soul or the
chief vital air or the highest Self.</p>
<p>The p&ucirc;rvapakshin maintains that the vital air is meant.
For, in the first place, he says, the clause 'of whom this is the
work' points to the activity of motion, and that activity rests on
the vital air. In the second place, we meet with the word
'pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a' in a complementary passage ('Then he becomes
one with that pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a alone'), and that word is well
known to denote the vital air. In the third place,
pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a is the maker of all the persons, the person in
the sun, the person in the moon, &amp;c., who in the preceding part
of the dialogue had been enumerated by B&acirc;l&acirc;ki; for that
the sun and the other divinities are mere differentiations of
pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a we know from another scriptural passage, viz.
'Who is that one god (in whom all the other gods are contained)?
pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a and he is Brahman, and they call him That'
(B<i>ri</i>. Up. III, 9, 9).&mdash;Or else, the p&ucirc;rvapakshin
continues, the passage under discussion represents the individual
soul as the object of knowledge. For of the soul also it can be
said that 'this is the work,' if we understand by 'this' all
meritorious and non-meritorious actions; and the soul also, in so
far as it is the enjoyer, can be viewed as the maker of the persons
enumerated in so far as they are instrumental to the soul's
fruition. The complementary passage, moreover, contains an
inferential mark of the individual soul. For
Aj&acirc;ta<i>s</i>atru, in order to instruct B&acirc;l&acirc;ki
about the 'maker of the persons' who had been proposed as the
object of knowledge, calls a sleeping man by various names and
convinces B&acirc;l&acirc;ki, by the circumstance that the sleeper
does not hear his shouts, that the pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a and so on are
not the enjoyers; he thereupon wakes the sleeping man by pushing
him with his stick, and so makes B&acirc;l&acirc;ki comprehend that
the being capable of fruition is the individual soul which is
distinct from the pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a. A subsequent passage also
contains an inferential mark of the individual soul, viz. 'And as
the master feeds with his people, nay, as his people feed on the
master, thus does this conscious Self feed with <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page270" id="page270"></a>{270}</span> the other
Selfs, thus those Selfs feed on the conscious Self' (Kau. Up. IV,
20). And as the individual soul is the support of the
pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a, it may itself be called
pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a.&mdash;We thus conclude that the passage under
discussion refers either to the individual soul or to the chief
vital air; but not to the Lord, of whom it contains no inferential
marks whatever.</p>
<p>To this we make the following reply.&mdash;The Lord only can be
the maker of the persons enumerated, on account of the force of the
introductory part of the section. B&acirc;l&acirc;ki begins his
colloquy with Aj&acirc;ta<i>s</i>atru with the offer, 'Shall I tell
you Brahman?' Thereupon he enumerates some individual souls
residing in the sun, the moon, and so on, which participate in the
sight of the secondary Brahman, and in the end becomes silent.
Aj&acirc;ta<i>s</i>atru then sets aside B&acirc;l&acirc;ki's
doctrine as not referring to the chief Brahman&mdash;with the
words, 'Vainly did you challenge me, saying, Shall I tell you
Brahman,' &amp;c.&mdash;and proposes the maker of all those
individual souls as a new object of knowledge. If now that maker
also were merely a soul participating in the sight of the secondary
Brahman, the introductory statement which speaks of Brahman would
be futile. Hence it follows that the highest Lord himself is
meant.&mdash;None, moreover, but the highest Lord is capable of
being the maker of all those persons as he only is absolutely
independent.&mdash;Further, the clause 'of whom this is the work'
does not refer either to the activity of motion nor to meritorious
and non-meritorious actions; for neither of those two is the topic
of discussion or has been mentioned previously. Nor can the term
'work' denote the enumerated persons, since the latter are
mentioned separately&mdash;in the clause, 'He who is the maker of
those persons'&mdash;and as inferential marks (viz. the neuter
gender and the singular number of the word karman, work) contradict
that assumption. Nor, again, can the term 'work' denote either the
activity whose object the persons are, or the result of that
activity, since those two are already implied in the mention of the
agent (in the clause, 'He who is the maker'). Thus there remains no
other alternative than to <span class="pagenum"><a name="page271"
id="page271"></a>{271}</span> take the pronoun 'this' (in 'He of
whom this is the work') as denoting the perceptible world and to
understand the same world&mdash;as that which is made&mdash;by the
term 'work.'&mdash;We may indeed admit that the world also is not
the previous topic of discussion and has not been mentioned before;
still, as no specification is mentioned, we conclude that the term
'work' has to be understood in a general sense, and thus denotes
what first presents itself to the mind, viz. everything which
exists in general. It is, moreover, not true that the world is not
the previous topic of discussion; we are rather entitled to
conclude from the circumstance that the various persons (in the
sun, the moon, &amp;c.) which constitute a part of the world had
been specially mentioned before, that the passage in question is
concerned with the whole world in general. The conjunction 'or' (in
'or he of whom,' &amp;c.) is meant to exclude the idea of limited
makership; so that the whole passage has to be interpreted as
follows, 'He who is the maker of those persons forming a part of
the world, or rather&mdash;to do away with this limitation&mdash;he
of whom this entire world without any exception is the work.' The
special mention made of the persons having been created has for its
purpose to show that those persons whom B&acirc;l&acirc;ki had
proclaimed to be Brahman are not Brahman. The passage therefore
sets forth the maker of the world in a double aspect, at first as
the creator of a special part of the world and thereupon as the
creator of the whole remaining part of the world; a way of speaking
analogous to such every-day forms of expression as, 'The wandering
mendicants are to be fed, and then the br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>as<a id=
"footnotetag242" name="footnotetag242"></a><a href=
"#footnote242"><sup>242</sup></a>.' And that the maker of the world
is the highest Lord is affirmed in all Ved&acirc;nta-texts.</p>
<p>17. If it be said that this is not so, on account of the
inferential marks of the individual soul and the chief vital air;
we reply that that has already been explained.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page272" id=
"page272"></a>{272}</span>
<p>It remains for us to refute the objection that on account of the
inferential marks of the individual soul and the chief vital air,
which are met with in the complementary passage, either the one or
the other must be meant in the passage under discussion, and not
the highest Lord.&mdash;We therefore remark that that objection has
already been disposed of under I, 1, 31. There it was shown that
from an interpretation similar to the one here proposed by the
p&ucirc;rvapakshin there would result a threefold meditation one
having Brahman for its object, a second one directed on the
individual soul, and a third one connected with the chief vital
air. Now the same result would present itself in our case, and that
would be unacceptable as we must infer from the introductory as
well as the concluding clauses, that the passage under discussion
refers to Brahman. With reference to the introductory clause this
has been already proved; that the concluding passage also refers to
Brahman, we infer from the fact of there being stated in it a
pre-eminently high reward, 'Warding off all evil he who knows this
obtains pre-eminence among all beings, sovereignty,
supremacy.'&mdash;But if this is so, the sense of the passage under
discussion is already settled by the discussion of the passage
about Pratarda<i>n</i>a (I, 1, 31); why, then, the present
S&ucirc;tra?&mdash;No, we reply; the sense of our passage is not
yet settled, since under I, 1, 31 it has not been proved that the
clause, 'Or he whose work is this,' refers to Brahman. Hence there
arises again, in connexion with the present passage, a doubt
whether the individual soul and the chief vital air may not be
meant, and that doubt has again to be refuted.&mdash;The word
pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a occurs, moreover, in the sense of Brahman, so in
the passage, 'The mind settles down on pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a' (Ch. Up.
VI, 8, 2).&mdash;The inferential marks of the individual soul also
have, on account of the introductory and concluding clauses
referring to Brahman, to be explained so as not to give rise to any
discrepancy.</p>
<p>18. But Jaimini thinks that (the reference to the individual
soul) has another purport, on account of <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page273" id="page273"></a>{273}</span> the
question and answer; and thus some also (read in their text).</p>
<p>Whether the passage under discussion is concerned with the
individual soul or with Brahman, is, in the opinion of the teacher
Jaimini, no matter for dispute, since the reference to the
individual soul has a different purport, i.e. aims at intimating
Brahman. He founds this his opinion on a question and a reply met
with in the text. After Aj&acirc;ta<i>s</i>atru has taught
B&acirc;l&acirc;ki, by waking the sleeping man, that the soul is
different from the vital air, he asks the following question,
'B&acirc;l&acirc;ki, where did this person here sleep? Where was
he? Whence came he thus back?' This question clearly refers to
something different from the individual soul. And so likewise does
the reply, 'When sleeping he sees no dream, then he becomes one
with that pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a alone;' and, 'From that Self all
pr&acirc;<i>n</i>as proceed, each towards its place, from the
pr&acirc;<i>n</i>as the gods, from the gods the worlds.'&mdash;Now
it is the general Ved&acirc;nta doctrine that at the time of deep
sleep the soul becomes one with the highest Brahman, and that from
the highest Brahman the whole world proceeds, inclusive of
pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a, and so on. When Scripture therefore represents
as the object of knowledge that in which there takes place the deep
sleep of the soul, characterised by absence of consciousness and
utter tranquillity, i.e. a state devoid of all those specific
cognitions which are produced by the limiting adjuncts of the soul,
and from which the soul returns when the sleep is broken; we
understand that the highest Self is meant.&mdash;Moreover, the
V&acirc;jasaneyi<i>s</i>&acirc;kh&acirc;, which likewise contains
the colloquy of B&acirc;l&acirc;ki and Aj&acirc;ta<i>s</i>atru,
clearly refers to the individual soul by means of the term, 'the
person consisting of cognition' (vij<i>&ntilde;</i>&acirc;namaya),
and distinguishes from it the highest Self ('Where was then the
person consisting of cognition? and from whence did he thus come
back?' B<i>ri</i>. Up. II, 1, 16); and later on, in the reply to
the above question, declares that 'the person consisting of
cognition lies in the ether within the heart.' Now we know that the
word 'ether' may be used to denote the highest Self, as, for
instance, in <span class="pagenum"><a name="page274" id=
"page274"></a>{274}</span> the passage about the small ether within
the lotus of the heart (Ch. Up. VIII, 1, 1). Further on the
B<i>ri</i>. Up. says, 'All the Selfs came forth from that Self;' by
which statement of the coming forth of all the conditioned Selfs it
intimates that the highest Self is the one general cause.&mdash;The
doctrine conveyed by the rousing of the sleeping person, viz. that
the individual soul is different from the vital air, furnishes at
the same time a further argument against the opinion that the
passage under discussion refers to the vital air.</p>
<p>19. (The Self to be seen, to be heard, &amp;c. is the highest
Self) on account of the connected meaning of the sentences.</p>
<p>We read in the B<i>ri</i>had&acirc;ra<i>n</i>yaka, in the
Maitrey&icirc;-br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a the following passage,
'Verily, a husband is not dear that you may love the husband,
&amp;c. &amp;c.; verily, everything is not dear that you may love
everything; but that you may love the Self therefore everything is
dear. Verily, the Self is to be seen, to be heard, to be perceived,
to be marked, O Maitrey&icirc;! When the Self has been seen, heard,
perceived, and known, then all this is known' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. IV,
5, 6).&mdash;Here the doubt arises whether that which is
represented as the object to be seen, to be heard, and so on, is
the cognitional Self (the individual soul) or the highest
Self.&mdash;But whence the doubt?&mdash;Because, we reply, the Self
is, on the one hand, by the mention of dear things such as husband
and so on, indicated as the enjoyer whence it appears that the
passage refers to the individual soul; and because, on the other
hand, the declaration that through the knowledge of the Self
everything becomes known points to the highest Self.</p>
<p>The p&ucirc;rvapakshin maintains that the passage refers to the
individual soul, on account of the strength of the initial
statement. The text declares at the outset that all the objects of
enjoyment found in this world, such as husband, wife, riches, and
so on, are dear on account of the Self, and thereby gives us to
understand that the enjoying (i.e. the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page275" id="page275"></a>{275}</span>
individual) Self is meant; if thereupon it refers to the Self as
the object of sight and so on, what other Self should it mean than
the same individual Self?&mdash;A subsequent passage also (viz.
'Thus does this great Being, endless, unlimited, consisting of
nothing but knowledge, rise from out of these elements, and vanish
again after them. When he has departed there is no more
knowledge'), which describes how the great Being under discussion
rises, as the Self of knowledge, from the elements, shows that the
object of sight is no other than the cognitional Self, i.e. the
individual soul. The concluding clause finally, 'How, O beloved,
should he know the knower?' shows, by means of the term 'knower,'
which denotes an agent, that the individual soul is meant. The
declaration that through the cognition of the Self everything
becomes known must therefore not be interpreted in the literal
sense, but must be taken to mean that the world of objects of
enjoyment is known through its relation to the enjoying soul.</p>
<p>To this we make the following reply.&mdash;The passage makes a
statement about the highest Self, on account of the connected
meaning of the entire section. If we consider the different
passages in their mutual connexion, we find that they all refer to
the highest Self. After Maitrey&icirc; has heard from
Y&acirc;j<i>&ntilde;</i>avalkya that there is no hope of
immortality by wealth, she expresses her desire of immortality in
the words, 'What should I do with that by which I do not become
immortal? What my Lord knoweth tell that to me;' and thereupon
Y&acirc;j<i>&ntilde;</i>avalkya expounds to her the knowledge of
the Self. Now Scripture as well as Sm<i>ri</i>ti declares that
immortality is not to be reached but through the knowledge of the
highest Self.&mdash;The statement further that through the
knowledge of the Self everything becomes known can be taken in its
direct literal sense only if by the Self we understand the highest
cause. And to take it in a non-literal sense (as the
p&ucirc;rvapakshin proposes) is inadmissible, on account of the
explanation given of that statement in a subsequent passage, viz.
'Whosoever looks for the Brahman class elsewhere than in the Self,
is abandoned by the Brahman class.' Here it is said that whoever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page276" id=
"page276"></a>{276}</span> erroneously views this world with its
Brahmans and so on, as having an independent existence apart from
the Self, is abandoned by that very world of which he has taken an
erroneous view; whereby the view that there exists any difference
is refuted. And the immediately subsequent clause, 'This everything
is the Self,' gives us to understand that the entire aggregate of
existing things is non-different from the Self; a doctrine further
confirmed by the similes of the drum and so on.&mdash;By explaining
further that the Self about which he had been speaking is the cause
of the universe of names, forms, and works ('There has been
breathed forth from this great Being what we have as
<i>Ri</i>gveda,' &amp;c.) Y&acirc;j<i>&ntilde;</i>avalkya again
shows that it is the highest Self.&mdash;To the same conclusion he
leads us by declaring, in the paragraph which treats of the natural
centres of things, that the Self is the centre of the whole world
with the objects, the senses and the mind, that it has neither
inside nor outside, that it is altogether a mass of
knowledge.&mdash;From all this it follows that what the text
represents as the object of sight and so on is the highest
Self.</p>
<p>We now turn to the remark made by the p&ucirc;rvapakshin that
the passage teaches the individual soul to be the object of sight,
because it is, in the early part of the chapter denoted as
something dear.</p>
<p>20. (The circumstance of the soul being represented as the
object of sight) indicates the fulfilment of the promissory
statement; so &Acirc;<i>s</i>marathya thinks.</p>
<p>The fact that the text proclaims as the object of sight that
Self which is denoted as something, dear indicates the fulfilment
of the promise made in the passages, 'When the Self is known all
this is known,' 'All this is that Self.' For if the individual soul
were different from the highest Self, the knowledge of the latter
would not imply the knowledge of the former, and thus the promise
that through the knowledge of one thing everything is to be known
would not be fulfilled. Hence the initial <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page277" id="page277"></a>{277}</span> statement
aims at representing the individual Self and the highest Self as
non-different for the purpose of fulfilling the promise
made.&mdash;This is the opinion of the teacher
&Acirc;<i>s</i>marathya<a id="footnotetag243" name=
"footnotetag243"></a><a href="#footnote243"><sup>243</sup></a>.</p>
<p>21. (The initial statement identifies the individual soul and
the highest Self) because the soul when it will depart (from the
body) is such (i.e. one with the highest Self); thus
Au<i>d</i>ulomi thinks.</p>
<p>The individual soul which is inquinated by the contact with its
different limiting adjuncts, viz. body, senses, and mind
(mano-buddhi), attains through the instrumentality of knowledge,
meditation, and so on, a state of complete serenity, and thus
enables itself, when passing at some future time out of the body,
to become one with the highest Self; hence the initial statement in
which it is represented as non-different from the highest Self.
This is the opinion of the teacher Au<i>d</i>ulomi.&mdash;Thus
Scripture says, 'That serene being arising from this body appears
in its own form as soon as it has approached the highest light'
(Ch. Up. VIII, 12, 3).&mdash;In another place Scripture intimates,
by means of the simile of the rivers, that name and form abide in
the individual soul, 'As <span class="pagenum"><a name="page278"
id="page278"></a>{278}</span> the flowing rivers disappear in the
sea, having lost their name and their form, thus a wise man freed
from name and form goes to the divine Person who is greater than
the great' (Mu. Up. III, 2, 8). I.e. as the rivers losing the names
and forms abiding in them disappear in the sea, so the individual
soul also losing the name and form abiding in it becomes united
with the highest person. That the latter half of the passage has
the meaning here assigned to it, follows from the parallelism which
we must assume to exist between the two members of the
comparison<a id="footnotetag244" name="footnotetag244"></a><a href=
"#footnote244"><sup>244</sup></a>.</p>
<p>22. (The initial statement is made) because (the highest Self)
exists in the condition (of the individual soul); so
K&acirc;<i>s</i>ak<i>ri</i>tsna thinks.</p>
<p>Because the highest Self exists also in the condition of the
individual soul, therefore, the teacher
K&acirc;<i>s</i>ak<i>ri</i>tsna thinks, the initial statement which
aims at intimating the non-difference of the two is possible. That
the highest Self only is that which appears as the individual soul,
is evident from the br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a-passage, 'Let me enter
into them with this living Self and evolve names and forms,' and
similar passages. We have also mantras to the same effect, for
instance, 'The wise one who, having produced all forms and made all
names, sits calling the things by their names' (Taitt. &Acirc;r.
III, 12, 7)<a id="footnotetag245" name=
"footnotetag245"></a><a href="#footnote245"><sup>245</sup></a>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page279" id=
"page279"></a>{279}</span> And where Scripture relates the creation
of fire and the other elements, it does not at the same time relate
a separate creation of the individual soul; we have therefore no
right to look on the soul as a product of the highest Self,
different from the latter.&mdash;In the opinion of the teacher
K&acirc;<i>s</i>ak<i>ri</i>tsna the non-modified highest Lord
himself is the individual soul, not anything else.
&Acirc;<i>s</i>marathya, although meaning to say that the soul is
not (absolutely) different from the highest Self, yet intimates by
the expression, 'On account of the fulfilment of the
promise'&mdash;which declares a certain mutual
dependence&mdash;that there does exist a certain relation of cause
and effect between the highest Self and the individual soul<a id=
"footnotetag246" name="footnotetag246"></a><a href=
"#footnote246"><sup>246</sup></a>. The opinion of Au<i>d</i>ulomi
again clearly implies that the difference and non-difference of the
two depend on difference of condition<a id="footnotetag247" name=
"footnotetag247"></a><a href="#footnote247"><sup>247</sup></a>. Of
these three opinions we conclude that the one held by
K&acirc;<i>s</i>ak<i>ri</i>tsna accords with Scripture, because it
agrees with what all the Ved&acirc;nta-texts (so, for instance, the
passage, 'That art thou') aim at inculcating. Only on the opinion
of K&acirc;<i>s</i>ak<i>ri</i>tsna immortality can be viewed as the
result of the knowledge of the soul; while it would be impossible
to hold the same view if the soul were a modification (product) of
the Self and as such liable to lose its existence by being merged
in its causal substance. For the same reason, name and form cannot
abide in the soul (as was above attempted to prove by means of the
simile of the rivers), but abide in the limiting adjunct and are
ascribed to the soul itself in a figurative sense only. For the
same reason the origin of the souls from the highest Self, of which
Scripture speaks in some places as analogous to the issuing of
sparks from the fire, must be viewed as based only on the limiting
adjuncts of the soul.</p>
<p>The last three S&ucirc;tras have further to be interpreted so as
to furnish replies to the second of the p&ucirc;rvapakshin's
arguments, viz. that the B<i>ri</i>had&acirc;ra<i>n</i>yaka passage
represents as <span class="pagenum"><a name="page280" id=
"page280"></a>{280}</span> the object of sight the individual soul,
because it declares that the great Being which is to be seen arises
from out of these elements. 'There is an indication of the
fulfilment of the promise; so &Acirc;<i>s</i>marathya thinks.' The
promise is made in the two passages, 'When the Self is known, all
this is known,' and 'All this is that Self.' That the Self is
everything, is proved by the declaration that the whole world of
names, forms, and works springs from one being, and is merged in
one being<a id="footnotetag248" name="footnotetag248"></a><a href=
"#footnote248"><sup>248</sup></a>; and by its being demonstrated,
with the help of the similes of the drum, and so on, that effect
and cause are non-different. The fulfilment of the promise is,
then, finally indicated by the text declaring that that great Being
rises, in the form of the individual soul, from out of these
elements; thus the teacher &Acirc;<i>s</i>marathya thinks. For if
the soul and the highest Self are non-different, the promise that
through the knowledge of one everything becomes known is capable of
fulfilment.&mdash;'Because the soul when it will depart is such;
thus Au<i>d</i>ulomi thinks.' The statement as to the
non-difference of the soul and the Self (implied in the declaration
that the great Being rises, &amp;c.) is possible, because the soul
when&mdash;after having purified itself by knowledge, and so
on&mdash;it will depart from the body, is capable of becoming one
with the highest Self. This is Au<i>d</i>ulomi's
opinion.&mdash;'Because it exists in the condition of the soul;
thus K&acirc;<i>s</i>ak<i>ri</i>tsna opines.' Because the highest
Self itself is that which appears as the individual soul, the
statement as to the non-difference of the two is well-founded. This
is the view of the teacher K&acirc;<i>s</i>ak<i>ri</i>tsna.</p>
<p>But, an objection may be raised, the passage, 'Rising from out
of these elements he vanishes again after them. When he has
departed there is no more knowledge,' intimates the final
destruction of the soul, not its identity with the highest
Self!&mdash;By no means, we reply. The passage means to say
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page281" id=
"page281"></a>{281}</span> only that on the soul departing from the
body all specific cognition vanishes, not that the Self is
destroyed. For an objection being raised&mdash;in the passage,
'Here thou hast bewildered me, Sir, when thou sayest that having
departed there is no more knowledge'. Scripture itself explains
that what is meant is not the annihilation of the Self, 'I say
nothing that is bewildering. Verily, beloved, that Self is
imperishable, and of an indestructible nature. But there takes
place non-connexion with the m&acirc;tr&acirc;s.' That means: The
eternally unchanging Self, which is one mass of knowledge, cannot
possibly perish; but by means of true knowledge there is effected
its dissociation from the m&acirc;tr&acirc;s, i.e. the elements and
the sense organs, which are the product of Nescience. When the
connexion has been solved, specific cognition, which depended on
it, no longer takes place, and thus it can be said, that 'When he
has departed there is no more knowledge.'</p>
<p>The third argument also of the p&ucirc;rvapakshin, viz. that the
word 'knower'&mdash;which occurs in the concluding passage, 'How
should he know the knower?'&mdash;denotes an agent, and therefore
refers to the individual soul as the object of sight, is to be
refuted according to the view of
K&acirc;<i>s</i>ak<i>ri</i>tsna.&mdash;Moreover, the text after
having enumerated&mdash;in the passage, 'For where there is duality
as it were, there one sees the other,' &amp;c.&mdash;all the kinds
of specific cognition which belong to the sphere of Nescience
declares&mdash;in the subsequent passage, 'But when the Self only
is all this, how should he see another?'&mdash;that in the sphere
of true knowledge all specific cognition such as seeing, and so on,
is absent. And, again, in order to obviate the doubt whether in the
absence of objects the knower might not know himself,
Y&acirc;j<i>&ntilde;</i>avalkya goes on, 'How, O beloved, should he
know himself, the knower?' As thus the latter passage evidently
aims at proving the absence of specific cognition, we have to
conclude that the word 'knower' is here used to denote that being
which is knowledge, i.e. the Self.&mdash;That the view of
K&acirc;<i>s</i>ak<i>ri</i>tsna is scriptural, we have already
shown above. And as it is so, all the adherents of the
Ved&acirc;nta must admit that the difference of the soul and the
highest Self is not <span class="pagenum"><a name="page282" id=
"page282"></a>{282}</span> real, but due to the limiting adjuncts,
viz. the body, and so on, which are the product of name and form as
presented by Nescience. That view receives ample confirmation from
Scripture; compare, for instance, 'Being only, my dear, this was in
the beginning, one, without a second' (Ch. Up. VI, 2, 1); 'The Self
is all this' (Ch. Up. VII, 25, 2); 'Brahman alone is all this' (Mu.
Up. II, 2, 11); 'This everything is that Self' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. II,
4, 6); 'There is no other seer but he' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. III, 7,
23); 'There is nothing that sees but it' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. III, 8,
11).&mdash;It is likewise confirmed by Sm<i>ri</i>ti; compare, for
instance, 'V&acirc;sudeva is all this' (Bha. G&icirc;. VII, 19);
'Know me, O Bh&acirc;rata, to be the soul in all bodies' (Bha.
G&icirc;. XIII, 2); 'He who sees the highest Lord abiding alike
within all creatures' (Bha. G&icirc;. XIII, 27).&mdash;The same
conclusion is supported by those passages which deny all
difference; compare, for instance, 'If he thinks, that is one and I
another; he does not know' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. I, 4, 10); 'From death
to death he goes who sees here any diversity' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. IV,
4, 19). And, again, by those passages which negative all change on
the part of the Self; compare, for instance, 'This great unborn
Self, undecaying, undying, immortal, fearless is indeed Brahman'
(B<i>ri</i>. Up. IV, 24).&mdash;Moreover, if the doctrine of
general identity were not true, those who are desirous of release
could not be in the possession of irrefutable knowledge, and there
would be no possibility of any matter being well settled; while yet
the knowledge of which the Self is the object is declared to be
irrefutable and to satisfy all desire, and Scripture speaks of
those, 'Who have well ascertained the object of the knowledge of
the Ved&acirc;nta' (Mu. Up. III, 2, 6). Compare also the passage,
'What trouble, what sorrow can there be to him who has once beheld
that unity?' (I<i>s</i>. Up. 7.)&mdash;And Sm<i>ri</i>ti also
represents the mind of him who contemplates the Self as steady
(Bha. G&icirc;. II, 54).</p>
<p>As therefore the individual soul and the highest Self differ in
name only, it being a settled matter that perfect knowledge has for
its object the absolute oneness of the two; it is senseless to
insist (as some do) on a plurality of Selfs, and to maintain that
the individual soul is different from the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page283" id="page283"></a>{283}</span> highest
Self, and the highest Self from the individual soul. For the Self
is indeed called by many different names, but it is one only. Nor
does the passage, 'He who knows Brahman which is real, knowledge,
infinite, as hidden in the cave' (Taitt. Up. II, 1), refer to some
one cave (different from the abode of the individual soul)<a id=
"footnotetag249" name="footnotetag249"></a><a href=
"#footnote249"><sup>249</sup></a>. And that nobody else but Brahman
is hidden in the cave we know from a subsequent passage, viz.
'Having sent forth he entered into it' (Taitt. Up. II, 6),
according to which the creator only entered into the created
beings.&mdash;Those who insist on the distinction of the individual
and the highest Self oppose themselves to the true sense of the
Ved&acirc;nta-texts, stand thereby in the way of perfect knowledge,
which is the door to perfect beatitude, and groundlessly assume
release to be something effected, and therefore non-eternal<a id=
"footnotetag250" name="footnotetag250"></a><a href=
"#footnote250"><sup>250</sup></a>. (And if they attempt to show
that moksha, although effected, is eternal) they involve themselves
in a conflict with sound logic.</p>
<p>23. (Brahman is) the material cause also, on account of (this
view) not being in conflict with the promissory statements and the
illustrative instances.</p>
<p>It has been said that, as practical religious duty has to be
enquired into because it is the cause of an increase of happiness,
so Brahman has to be enquired into because it is the cause of
absolute beatitude. And Brahman has been defined as that from which
there proceed the origination, sustentation, and retractation of
this world. Now as this definition comprises alike the relation of
substantial causality in which clay and gold, for instance, stand
to golden ornaments and earthen pots, and the relation of operative
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page284" id=
"page284"></a>{284}</span> causality in which the potter and the
goldsmith stand to the things mentioned; a doubt arises to which of
these two kinds the causality of Brahman belongs.</p>
<p>The p&ucirc;rvapakshin maintains that Brahman evidently is the
operative cause of the world only, because Scripture declares his
creative energy to be preceded by reflection. Compare, for
instance, Pra. Up. VI, 3; 4: 'He reflected, he created
pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a.' For observation shows that the action of
operative causes only, such as potters and the like, is preceded by
reflection, and moreover that the result of some activity is
brought about by the concurrence of several factors<a id=
"footnotetag251" name="footnotetag251"></a><a href=
"#footnote251"><sup>251</sup></a>. It is therefore appropriate that
we should view the prime creator in the same light. The
circumstance of his being known as 'the Lord' furnishes another
argument. For lords such as kings and the son of Vivasvat are known
only as operative causes, and the highest Lord also must on that
account be viewed as an operative cause only.&mdash;Further, the
effect of the creator's activity, viz. this world, is seen to
consist of parts, to be non-intelligent and impure; we therefore
must assume that its cause also is of the same nature; for it is a
matter of general observation that cause and effect are alike in
kind. But that Brahman does not resemble the world in nature, we
know from many scriptural passages, such as 'It is without parts,
without actions, tranquil, without fault, without taint'
(<i>Sv</i>e. Up. VI, 19). Hence there remains no other alternative
but to admit that in addition to Brahman there exists a material
cause of the world of impure nature, such as is known from
Sm<i>ri</i>ti<a id="footnotetag252" name=
"footnotetag252"></a><a href="#footnote252"><sup>252</sup></a>, and
to limit the causality of Brahman, as declared by Scripture, to
operative causality.</p>
<p>To this we make the following reply.&mdash;Brahman is to be
acknowledged as the material cause as well as the operative cause;
because this latter view does not conflict with the promissory
statements and the illustrative instances. The promissory statement
chiefly meant is the following one, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page285" id="page285"></a>{285}</span> 'Have you ever asked for
that instruction by which that which is not heard becomes heard;
that which is not perceived, perceived; that which is not known,
known?' (Ch. Up. VI, 1, 3.) This passage intimates that through the
cognition of one thing everything else, even if (previously)
unknown, becomes known. Now the knowledge of everything is possible
through the cognition of the material cause, since the effect is
non-different from the material cause. On the other hand, effects
are not non-different from their operative causes; for we know from
ordinary experience that the carpenter, for instance, is different
from the house he has built.&mdash;The illustrative example
referred to is the one mentioned (Ch. Up. VI, 1, 4), 'My dear, as
by one clod of clay all that is made of clay is known, the
modification (i.e. the effect) being a name merely which has its
origin in speech, while the truth is that it is clay merely;' which
passage again has reference to the material cause. The text adds a
few more illustrative instances of similar nature, 'As by one
nugget of gold all that is made of gold is known; as by one pair of
nail-scissors all that is made of iron is known.'&mdash;Similar
promissory statements are made in other places also, for instance,
'What is that through which if it is known everything else becomes
known?' (Mu. Up. I, 1, 3.) An illustrative instance also is given
in the same place, 'As plants grow on the earth' (I, 1,
7).&mdash;Compare also the promissory statement in B<i>ri</i>. Up.
IV, 5, 6, 'When the Self has been seen, heard, perceived, and
known, then all this is known;' and the illustrative instance
quoted (IV, 5, 8), 'Now as the sounds of a drum if beaten cannot be
seized externally, but the sound is seized when the drum is seized
or the beater of the drum.'&mdash;Similar promissory statements and
illustrative instances which are to be found in all
Ved&acirc;nta-texts are to be viewed as proving, more or less, that
Brahman is also the material cause of the world. The ablative case
also in the passage, 'That from whence (yata<i>h</i>) these beings
are born,' has to be considered as indicating the material cause of
the beings, according to the grammatical rule, P&acirc;<i>n</i>. I,
4, 30.&mdash;That Brahman is at the same time the operative cause
of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page286" id=
"page286"></a>{286}</span> world, we have to conclude from the
circumstance that there is no other guiding being. Ordinarily
material causes, indeed, such as lumps of clay and pieces of gold,
are dependent, in order to shape themselves into vessels and
ornaments, on extraneous operative causes such as potters and
goldsmiths; but outside Brahman as material cause there is no other
operative cause to which the material cause could look; for
Scripture says that previously to creation Brahman was one without
a second.&mdash;The absence of a guiding principle other than the
material cause can moreover be established by means of the argument
made use of in the S&ucirc;tra, viz. accordance with the promissory
statements and the illustrative examples. If there were admitted a
guiding principle different from the material cause, it would
follow that everything cannot be known through one thing, and
thereby the promissory statements as well as the illustrative
instances would be stultified.&mdash;The Self is thus the operative
cause, because there is no other ruling principle, and the material
cause because there is no other substance from which the world
could originate.</p>
<p>24. And on account of the statement of reflection (on the part
of the Self).</p>
<p>The fact of the sacred texts declaring that the Self reflected
likewise shows that it is the operative as well as the material
cause. Passages like 'He wished, may I be many, may I grow forth,'
and 'He thought, may I be many, may I grow forth,' show, in the
first place, that the Self is the agent in the independent activity
which is preceded by the Self's reflection; and, in the second
place, that it is the material cause also, since the words 'May I
be many' intimate that the reflective desire of multiplying itself
has the inward Self for its object.</p>
<p>25. And on account of both (i.e. the origin and the dissolution
of the world) being directly declared (to have Brahman for their
material cause).</p>
<p>This S&ucirc;tra supplies a further argument for Brahman's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page287" id=
"page287"></a>{287}</span> being the general material
cause.&mdash;Brahman is the material cause of the world for that
reason also that the origination as well as the dissolution of the
world is directly spoken of in the sacred texts as having Brahman
for their material cause, 'All these beings take their rise from
the ether and return into the ether' (Ch. Up. I, 9, 1). That that
from which some other thing springs and into which it returns is
the material cause of that other thing is well known. Thus the
earth, for instance, is the material cause of rice, barley, and the
like.&mdash;The word 'directly' (in the S&ucirc;tra) notifies that
there is no other material cause, but that all this sprang from the
ether only.&mdash;Observation further teaches that effects are not
re-absorbed into anything else but their material causes.</p>
<p>26. (Brahman is the material cause) on account of (the Self)
making itself; (which is possible) owing to modification.</p>
<p>Brahman is the material cause for that reason also that
Scripture&mdash;in the passage, 'That made itself its Self' (Taitt.
Up. II, 7)&mdash;represents the Self as the object of action as
well as the agent.&mdash;But how can the Self which as agent was in
full existence previously to the action be made out to be at the
same time that which is effected by the action?&mdash;Owing to
modification, we reply. The Self, although in full existence
previously to the action, modifies itself into something special,
viz. the Self of the effect. Thus we see that causal substances,
such as clay and the like, are, by undergoing the process of
modification, changed into their products.&mdash;The word 'itself'
in the passage quoted intimates the absence of any other operative
cause but the Self.</p>
<p>The word 'pari<i>n</i>&acirc;m&acirc;t' (in the S&ucirc;tra) may
also be taken as constituting a separate S&ucirc;tra by itself, the
sense of which would be: Brahman is the material cause of the world
for that reason also, that the sacred text speaks of Brahman and
its modification into the Self of its effect as co-ordinated, viz.
in the passage, 'It became sat and tyat, defined and undefined'
(Taitt. Up. II, 6).</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page288" id=
"page288"></a>{288}</span>
<p>27. And because Brahman is called the source.</p>
<p>Brahman is the material cause for that reason also that it is
spoken of in the sacred texts as the source (yoni); compare, for
instance, 'The maker, the Lord, the person who has his source in
Brahman' (Mu. Up. III, 1, 3); and 'That which the wise regard as
the source of all beings' (Mu. Up. I, 1, 6). For that the word
'source' denotes the material cause is well known from the use of
ordinary language; the earth, for instance, is called the yoni of
trees and herbs. In some places indeed the word yoni means not
source, but merely place; so, for instance, in the mantra, 'A yoni,
O Indra, was made for you to sit down upon' (<i>Ri</i>k.
Sa<i>m</i>h. I, 104, 1). But that in the passage quoted it means
'source' follows from a complementary passage, 'As the spider sends
forth and draws in its threads,' &amp;c.&mdash;It is thus proved
that Brahman is the material cause of the world.&mdash;Of the
objection, finally, that in ordinary life the activity of operative
causal agents only, such as potters and the like, is preceded by
reflection, we dispose by the remark that, as the matter in hand is
not one which can be known through inferential reasoning, ordinary
experience cannot be used to settle it. For the knowledge of that
matter we rather depend on Scripture altogether, and hence
Scripture only has to be appealed to. And that Scripture teaches
that the Lord who reflects before creation is at the same time the
material cause, we have already explained. The subject will,
moreover, be discussed more fully later on.</p>
<p>28. Hereby all (the doctrines concerning the origin of the world
which are opposed to the Ved&acirc;nta) are explained, are
explained.</p>
<p>The doctrine according to which the pradh&acirc;na is the cause
of the world has, in the S&ucirc;tras beginning with I, 1, 5, been
again and again brought forward and refuted. The chief reason for
the special attention given to that doctrine is that the
Ved&acirc;nta-texts contain some passages which, to people
deficient in mental penetration, may appear to contain inferential
marks pointing to it. The <span class="pagenum"><a name="page289"
id="page289"></a>{289}</span> doctrine, moreover, stands somewhat
near to the Ved&acirc;nta doctrine since, like the latter, it
admits the non-difference of cause and effect, and it, moreover,
has been accepted by some of the authors of the
Dharma-s&ucirc;tras, such as Devala, and so on. For all these
reasons we have taken special trouble to refute the pradh&acirc;na
doctrine, without paying much attention to the atomic and other
theories. These latter theories, however, must likewise be refuted,
as they also are opposed to the doctrine of Brahman being the
general cause, and as slow-minded people might think that they also
are referred to in some Vedic passages. Hence the
S&ucirc;trak&acirc;ra formally extends, in the above S&ucirc;tra,
the refutation already accomplished of the pradh&acirc;na doctrine
to all similar doctrines which need not be demolished in detail
after their great protagonist, the pradh&acirc;na doctrine, has
been so completely disposed of. They also are, firstly, not founded
on any scriptural authority; and are, secondly, directly
contradicted by various Vedic passages.&mdash;The repetition of the
phrase 'are explained' is meant to intimate that the end of the
adhy&acirc;ya has been reached.</p>

absolutely different from Brahman, for that would mean that they
are not of the nature of intelligence; nor absolutely non-different
from Brahman, because in that case they could not be distinguished
from each other, and because, if they were identical with Brahman
and therefore omniscient, it would be useless to give them any
instruction. Hence the individual souls are somehow different from

from the highest Self; it is inquinated by the contact with its
different limiting adjuncts. But it is spoken of, in the Upanishad,
as non-different from the highest Self because after having
purified itself by means of knowledge and meditation it may pass
out of the body and become one with the highest Self. The text of
the Upanishad thus transfers a future state of non-difference to
that time when difference actually exists. Compare the saying of
the P&acirc;<i>&ntilde;k</i>ar&acirc;trikas: 'Up to the moment of
emancipation being reached the soul and the highest Self are
different. But the emancipated soul is no longer different from the

<h3>SECOND ADHY&Acirc;YA.</h3>
<h4>FIRST P&Acirc;DA.</h4>
<center>REVERENCE TO THE HIGHEST SELF!</center>
<p>1. If it be objected that (from the doctrine expounded hitherto)
there would result the fault of there being no room for (certain)
Sm<i>ri</i>tis; we do not admit that objection, because (from the
rejection of our doctrine) there would result the fault of want of
room for other Sm<i>ri</i>tis.</p>
<p>It has been shown in the first adhy&acirc;ya that the omniscient
Lord of all is the cause of the origin of this world in the same
way as clay is the material cause of jars and gold of golden
ornaments; that by his rulership he is the cause of the subsistence
of this world once originated, just as the magician is the cause of
the subsistence of the magical illusion; and that he, lastly, is
the cause of this emitted world being finally reabsorbed into his
essence, just as the four classes of creatures are reabsorbed into
the earth. It has further been proved, by a demonstration of the
connected meaning of all the Ved&acirc;nta-texts, that the Lord is
the Self of all of us. Moreover, the doctrines of the
pradh&acirc;na, and so on, being the cause of this world have been
refuted as not being scriptural.&mdash;The purport of the second
adhy&acirc;ya, which we now begin, is to refute the objections (to
the doctrine established hitherto) which might be founded on
Sm<i>ri</i>ti and Reasoning, and to show that the doctrines of the
pradh&acirc;na, &amp;c. have only fallacious arguments to lean
upon, and that the different Ved&acirc;nta-texts do not contradict
one another with regard to the mode of creation and similar
topics.&mdash;The first point is to refute the objections based on
Sm<i>ri</i>ti.</p>
<p>Your doctrine (the p&ucirc;rvapakshin says) that the omniscient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page291" id=
"page291"></a>{291}</span> Brahman only is the cause of this world
cannot be maintained, 'because there results from it the fault of
there being no room for (certain) Sm<i>ri</i>tis.' Such
Sm<i>ri</i>tis are the one called Tantra which was composed by a
<i>ri</i>shi and is accepted by authoritative persons, and other
Sm<i>ri</i>tis based on it<a id="footnotetag253" name=
"footnotetag253"></a><a href="#footnote253"><sup>253</sup></a>; for
all of which there would be no room if your interpretation of the
Veda were the true one. For they all teach that the non-intelligent
pradh&acirc;na is the independent cause of the world. There is
indeed room (a raison d'&ecirc;tre) for Sm<i>ri</i>tis like the
Manu-sm<i>ri</i>ti, which give information about matters connected
with the whole body of religious duty, characterised by
injunction<a id="footnotetag254" name="footnotetag254"></a><a href=
"#footnote254"><sup>254</sup></a> and comprising the agnihotra and
similar performances. They tell us at what time and with what rites
the members of the different castes are to be initiated; how the
Veda has to be studied; in what way the cessation of study has to
take place; how marriage has to be performed, and so on. They
further lay down the manifold religious duties, beneficial to man,
of the four castes and &acirc;<i>s</i>ramas<a id="footnotetag255"
name="footnotetag255"></a><a href=
"#footnote255"><sup>255</sup></a>. The K&acirc;pila Sm<i>ri</i>ti,
on the other hand, and similar books are not concerned with things
to be done, but were composed with exclusive reference to perfect
knowledge as the means of final release. If then no room were left
for them in that connexion also, they would be altogether
purposeless; and hence we must explain the Ved&acirc;nta-texts in
such a manner as not to bring them into conflict with the
Sm<i>ri</i>tis mentioned<a id="footnotetag256" name=
"footnotetag256"></a><a href=
"#footnote256"><sup>256</sup></a>.&mdash;But how, somebody may ask
the p&ucirc;rvapakshin, can the eventual fault of there being left
no room for certain Sm<i>ri</i>tis be used as an objection against
that sense of <i>S</i>ruti which&mdash;from various <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page292" id="page292"></a>{292}</span> reasons
as detailed under I, 1 and ff.&mdash;has been ascertained by us to
be the true one, viz. that the omniscient Brahman alone is the
cause of the world?&mdash;Our objection, the p&ucirc;rvapakshin
replies, will perhaps not appear valid to persons of independent
thought; but as most men depend in their reasonings on others, and
are unable to ascertain by themselves the sense of <i>S</i>ruti,
they naturally rely on Sm<i>ri</i>tis, composed by celebrated
authorities, and try to arrive at the sense of <i>S</i>ruti with
their assistance; while, owing to their esteem for the authors of
the Sm<i>ri</i>tis, they have no trust in our explanations. The
knowledge of men like Kapila Sm<i>ri</i>ti declares to have been
<i>ri</i>shi-like and unobstructed, and moreover there is the
following <i>S</i>ruti-passage, 'It is he who, in the beginning,
bears in his thoughts the son, the <i>ri</i>shi, kapila<a id=
"footnotetag257" name="footnotetag257"></a><a href=
"#footnote257"><sup>257</sup></a>, whom he wishes to look on while
he is born' (<i>S</i>ve. Up. V, 2). Hence their opinion cannot be
assumed to be erroneous, and as they moreover strengthen their
position by argumentation, the objection remains valid, and we must
therefore attempt to explain the Ved&acirc;nta-texts in conformity
with the Sm<i>ri</i>tis.</p>
<p>This objection we dispose of by the remark, 'It is not so
because therefrom would result the fault of want of room for other
Sm<i>ri</i>tis.'&mdash;If you object to the doctrine of the Lord
being the cause of the world on the ground that it would render
certain Sm<i>ri</i>tis purposeless, you thereby render purposeless
other Sm<i>ri</i>tis which declare themselves in favour of the said
doctrine. These latter Sm<i>ri</i>ti-texts we will quote in what
follows. In one passage the highest Brahman is introduced as the
subject of discussion, 'That which is subtle and not to be known;'
the text then goes on, 'That is the internal Self of the creatures,
their soul,' and after that remarks 'From that sprang the
Unevolved, consisting of the three gu<i>n</i>as, O best of
br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>as.' And in another place it is said that 'the
Unevolved is <span class="pagenum"><a name="page293" id=
"page293"></a>{293}</span> dissolved in the Person devoid of
qualities, O br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a.'&mdash;Thus we read also in the
Pur&acirc;<i>n</i>a, 'Hear thence this short statement: The ancient
N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<i>n</i>a is all this; he produces the creation
at the due time, and at the time of reabsorption he consumes it
again.' And so in the Bhagavadg&icirc;t&acirc; also (VII, 6), 'I am
the origin and the place of reabsorption of the whole world.' And
&Acirc;pastamba too says with reference to the highest Self, 'From
him spring all bodies; he is the primary cause, he is eternal, he
is unchangeable' (Dharma S&ucirc;tra I, 8, 23, 2). In this way
Sm<i>ri</i>ti, in many places, declares the Lord to be the
efficient as well as the material cause of the world. As the
p&ucirc;rvapakshin opposes us on the ground of Sm<i>ri</i>ti, we
reply to him on the ground of Sm<i>ri</i>ti only; hence the line of
defence taken up in the S&ucirc;tra. Now it has been shown already
that the <i>S</i>ruti-texts aim at conveying the doctrine that the
Lord is the universal cause, and as wherever different
Sm<i>ri</i>tis conflict those maintaining one view must be
accepted, while those which maintain the opposite view must be set
aside, those Sm<i>ri</i>tis which follow <i>S</i>ruti are to be
considered as authoritative, while all others are to be
disregarded; according to the S&ucirc;tra met with in the chapter
treating of the means of proof (M&icirc;m. S&ucirc;tra I, 3, 3),
'Where there is contradiction (between <i>S</i>ruti and
Sm<i>ri</i>ti) (Sm<i>ri</i>ti) is to be disregarded; in case of
there being no (contradiction) (Sm<i>ri</i>ti is to be recognised)
as there is inference (of Sm<i>ri</i>ti being founded on
<i>S</i>ruti).'&mdash;Nor can we assume that some persons are able
to perceive supersensuous matters without <i>S</i>ruti, as there
exists no efficient cause for such perception. Nor, again, can it
be said that such perception may be assumed in the case of Kapila
and others who possessed supernatural powers, and consequently
unobstructed power of cognition. For the possession of supernatural
powers itself depends on the performance of religious duty, and
religious duty is that which is characterised by injunction<a id=
"footnotetag258" name="footnotetag258"></a><a href=
"#footnote258"><sup>258</sup></a>; hence the sense of injunctions
(i.e. of the Veda) <span class="pagenum"><a name="page294" id=
"page294"></a>{294}</span> which is established first must not be
fancifully interpreted in reference to the dicta of men
'established' (i.e. made perfect, and therefore possessing
supernatural powers) afterwards only. Moreover, even if those
'perfect' men were accepted as authorities to be appealed to,
still, as there are many such perfect men, we should have, in all
those cases where the Sm<i>ri</i>tis contradict each other in the
manner described, no other means of final decision than an appeal
to <i>S</i>ruti.&mdash;As to men destitute of the power of
independent judgment, we are not justified in assuming that they
will without any reason attach themselves to some particular
Sm<i>ri</i>ti; for if men's inclinations were so altogether
unregulated, truth itself would, owing to the multiformity of human
opinion, become unstable. We must therefore try to lead their
judgment in the right way by pointing out to them the conflict of
the Sm<i>ri</i>tis, and the distinction founded on some of them
following <i>S</i>ruti and others not.&mdash;The scriptural passage
which the p&ucirc;rvapakshin has quoted as proving the eminence of
Kapila's knowledge would not justify us in believing in such
doctrines of Kapila (i.e. of some Kapila) as are contrary to
Scripture; for that passage mentions the bare name of Kapila
(without specifying which Kapila is meant), and we meet in
tradition with another Kapila, viz. the one who burned the sons of
Sagara and had the surname V&acirc;sudeva. That passage, moreover,
serves another purpose, (viz. the establishment of the doctrine of
the highest Self,) and has on that account no force to prove what
is not proved by any other means, (viz. the supereminence of
Kapila's knowledge.) On the other hand, we have a
<i>S</i>ruti-passage which proclaims the excellence of Manu<a id=
"footnotetag259" name="footnotetag259"></a><a href=
"#footnote259"><sup>259</sup></a>, viz. 'Whatever Manu said is
medicine' (Taitt. Sa<i>m</i>h. II, 2, 10, 2). Manu himself, where
he glorifies the seeing of the one Self in everything ('he who
equally sees the Self in all beings and all beings in the Self, he
as a sacrificer to the Self attains self-luminousness,'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page295" id=
"page295"></a>{295}</span> i.e. becomes Brahman, Manu Sm<i>ri</i>ti
XII, 91), implicitly blames the doctrine of Kapila. For Kapila, by
acknowledging a plurality of Selfs, does not admit the doctrine of
there being one universal Self. In the Mahabh&acirc;rata also the
question is raised whether there are many persons (souls) or one;
thereupon the opinion of others is mentioned, 'There are many
persons, O King, according to the S&acirc;@nkhya and Yoga
philosophers;' that opinion is controverted 'just as there is one
place of origin, (viz. the earth,) for many persons, so I will
proclaim to you that universal person raised by his qualities;'
and, finally, it is declared that there is one universal Self, 'He
is the internal Self of me, of thee, and of all other embodied
beings, the internal witness of all, not to be apprehended by any
one. He the all-headed, all-armed, all-footed, all-eyed, all-nosed
one moves through all beings according to his will and liking.' And
Scripture also declares that there is one universal Self, 'When to
a man who understands the Self has become all things, what sorrow,
what trouble can there be to him who once beheld that unity?'
(&Icirc;<i>s</i>. Up 7); and other similar passages. All which
proves that the system of Kapila contradicts the Veda, and the
doctrine of Manu who follows the Veda, by its hypothesis of a
plurality of Selfs also, not only by the assumption of an
independent pradh&acirc;na. The authoritativeness of the Veda with
regard to the matters stated by it is independent and direct, just
as the light of the sun is the direct means of our knowledge of
form and colour; the authoritativeness of human dicta, on the other
hand, is of an altogether different kind, as it depends on an
extraneous basis (viz. the Veda), and is (not immediate but)
mediated by a chain of teachers and tradition.</p>
<p>Hence the circumstance that the result (of our doctrine) is want
of room for certain Sm<i>ri</i>tis, with regard to matters
contradicted by the Veda, furnishes no valid objection.&mdash;An
additional reason for this our opinion is supplied by the following
S&ucirc;tra.</p>
<p>2. And on account of the non-perception of the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page296" id="page296"></a>{296}</span> others
(i.e. the effects of the pradh&acirc;na, according to the
S&acirc;@nkhya system).</p>
<p>The principles different from the pradh&acirc;na, but to be
viewed as its modifications which the (S&acirc;@nkhya)
Sm<i>ri</i>ti assumes, as, for instance, the great principle, are
perceived neither in the Veda nor in ordinary experience. Now
things of the nature of the elements and the sense organs, which
are well known from the Veda, as well as from experience, may be
referred to in Sm<i>ri</i>ti; but with regard to things which, like
Kapila's great principle, are known neither from the Veda nor from
experience&mdash;no more than, for instance, the objects of a sixth
sense&mdash;Sm<i>ri</i>ti is altogether impossible. That some
scriptural passages which apparently refer to such things as the
great principle have in reality quite a different meaning has
already been shown under I, 4, 1. But if that part of Sm<i>ri</i>ti
which is concerned with the effects (i.e. the great principle, and
so on) is without authority, the part which refers to the cause
(the pradh&acirc;na) will be so likewise. This is what the
S&ucirc;tra means to say.&mdash;We have thus established a second
reason, proving that the circumstance of there being no room left
for certain Sm<i>ri</i>tis does not constitute a valid objection to
our doctrine.&mdash;The weakness of the trust in reasoning
(apparently favouring the S&acirc;@nkhya doctrine) will be shown
later on under II, 1, 4 ff.</p>
<p>3. Thereby the Yoga (Sm<i>ri</i>ti) is refuted.</p>
<p>This S&ucirc;tra extends the application of the preceding
argumentation, and remarks that by the refutation of the
S&acirc;@nkhya-sm<i>ri</i>ti the Yoga-sm<i>ri</i>ti also is to be
considered as refuted; for the latter also assumes, in opposition
to Scripture, a pradh&acirc;na as the independent cause of the
world, and the 'great principle,' &amp;c. as its effects, although
neither the Veda nor common experience favour these
views.&mdash;But, if the same reasoning applies to the Yoga also,
the latter system is already disposed of by the previous arguments;
of what use then is it formally to extend them to the Yoga? (as the
S&ucirc;tra does.)&mdash;We reply that here an additional
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page297" id=
"page297"></a>{297}</span> cause of doubt presents itself, the
practice of Yoga being enjoined in the Veda as a means of obtaining
perfect knowledge; so, for instance, B<i>ri</i>. Up. II, 4, 5,
'(The Self) is to be heard, to be thought, to be meditated
upon<a id="footnotetag260" name="footnotetag260"></a><a href=
"#footnote260"><sup>260</sup></a>.' In the
<i>S</i>vet&acirc;<i>s</i>vatara Upanishad, moreover, we find
various injunctions of Yoga-practice connected with the assumption
of different positions of the body; &amp;c.; so, for instance,
'Holding his body with its three erect parts even,' &amp;c. (II,
8).</p>
<p>Further, we find very many passages in the Veda which (without
expressly enjoining it) point to the Yoga, as, for instance, Ka.
Up. II, 6, 11, 'This, the firm holding back of the senses, is what
is called Yoga;' 'Having received this knowledge and the whole rule
of Yoga' (Ka. Up. II, 6, 18); and so on. And in the
Yoga-<i>s</i>&acirc;stra itself the passage, 'Now then Yoga, the
means of the knowledge of truth,' &amp;c. defines the Yoga as a
means of reaching perfect knowledge. As thus one topic of the
<i>s</i>&acirc;stra at least (viz. the practice of Yoga) is shown
to be authoritative, the entire Yoga-sm<i>ri</i>ti will have to be
accepted as unobjectionable, just as the Sm<i>ri</i>ti referring to
the ash<i>t</i>ak&acirc;s<a id="footnotetag261" name=
"footnotetag261"></a><a href=
"#footnote261"><sup>261</sup></a>.&mdash;To this we reply that the
formal extension (to the Yoga, of the arguments primarily directed
against the S&acirc;@nkhya) has the purpose of removing the
additional doubt stated in the above lines; for in spite of a part
of the Yoga-sm<i>ri</i>ti being authoritative, the disagreement
(between Sm<i>ri</i>ti and <i>S</i>ruti) on other topics remains as
shown above.&mdash;Although<a id="footnotetag262" name=
"footnotetag262"></a><a href="#footnote262"><sup>262</sup></a>
there are many Sm<i>ri</i>tis treating of the soul, we have singled
out for refutation the S&acirc;@nkhya and Yoga because they are
widely known as offering the means for accomplishing the highest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page298" id=
"page298"></a>{298}</span> end of man and have found favour with
many competent persons. Moreover, their position is strengthened by
a Vedic passage referring to them, 'He who has known that cause
which is to be apprehended by S&acirc;@nkhya and Yoga he is freed
from all fetters' (<i>S</i>ve. Up. VI, 13). (The claims which on
the ground of this last passage might be set up for the
S&acirc;@nkhya and Yoga-sm<i>ri</i>tis in their entirety) we refute
by the remark that the highest beatitude (the highest aim of man)
is not to be attained by the knowledge of the
S&acirc;@nkhya-sm<i>ri</i>ti irrespective of the Veda, nor by the
road of Yoga-practice. For Scripture itself declares that there is
no other means of obtaining the highest beatitude but the knowledge
of the unity of the Self which is conveyed by the Veda, 'Over death
passes only the man who knows him; there is no other path to go'
(<i>S</i>ve. Up. III, 8). And the S&acirc;@nkhya and Yoga-systems
maintain duality, do not discern the unity of the Self. In the
passage quoted ('That cause which is to be apprehended by
S&acirc;@nkhya and Yoga') the terms 'S&acirc;@nkhya' and 'Yoga'
denote Vedic knowledge and meditation, as we infer from
proximity<a id="footnotetag263" name="footnotetag263"></a><a href=
"#footnote263"><sup>263</sup></a>. We willingly allow room for
those portions of the two systems which do not contradict the Veda.
In their description of the soul, for instance, as free from all
qualities the S&acirc;@nkhyas are in harmony with the Veda which
teaches that the person (purusha) is essentially pure; cp.
B<i>ri</i>. Up. IV, 3, 16. 'For that person is not attached to
anything.' The Yoga again in giving rules for the condition of the
wandering religious mendicant admits that state of retirement from
the concerns of life which is known from scriptural passages such
as the following one, 'Then the parivr&acirc;jaka with discoloured
(yellow) dress, shaven, without any possessions,' &amp;c.
(J&acirc;b&acirc;la Upan. IV).</p>
<p>The above remarks will serve as a reply to the claims of all
argumentative Sm<i>ri</i>tis. If it be said that those
Sm<i>ri</i>tis also assist, by argumentation and proof, the
cognition of truth, we do not object to so much, but we maintain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page299" id=
"page299"></a>{299}</span> all the same that the truth can be known
from the Ved&acirc;nta-texts only; as is stated by scriptural
passages such as 'None who does not know the Veda perceives that
great one' (Taitt. Br. III, 12, 9, 7); 'I now ask thee that person
taught in the Upanishads' (B<i>ri</i>. Up, III, 9, 26); and
others.</p>
<p>4. (Brahman can) not (be the cause of the world) on account of
the difference of character of that, (viz. the world); and its
being such, (i.e. different from Brahman) (we learn) from
Scripture.</p>
<p>The objections, founded on Sm<i>ri</i>ti, against the doctrine
of Brahman being the efficient and the material cause of this world
have been refuted; we now proceed to refute those founded on
Reasoning.&mdash;But (to raise an objection at the outset) how is
there room for objections founded on Reasoning after the sense of
the sacred texts has once been settled? The sacred texts are
certainly to be considered absolutely authoritative with regard to
Brahman as well as with regard to religious duty
(dharma).&mdash;(To this the p&ucirc;rvapakshin replies), The
analogy between Brahman and dharma would hold good if the matter in
hand were to be known through the holy texts only, and could not be
approached by the other means of right knowledge also. In the case
of religious duties, i.e. things to be done, we indeed entirely
depend on Scripture. But now we are concerned with Brahman which is
an accomplished existing thing, and in the case of accomplished
things there is room for other means of right knowledge also, as,
for instance, the case of earth and the other elements shows. And
just as in the case of several conflicting scriptural passages we
explain all of them in such a manner as to make them accord with
one, so <i>S</i>ruti, if in conflict with other means of right
knowledge, has to be bent so as to accord with the letter.
Moreover, Reasoning, which enables us to infer something not
actually perceived in consequence of its having a certain equality
of attributes with what is actually perceived, stands nearer to
perception than <i>S</i>ruti which conveys its sense by tradition
merely. And the knowledge <span class="pagenum"><a name="page300"
id="page300"></a>{300}</span> of Brahman which discards Nescience
and effects final release terminates in a perception (viz. the
intuition&mdash;s&acirc;ksh&acirc;tk&acirc;ra&mdash;of Brahman),
and as such must be assumed to have a seen result (not an unseen
one like dharma)<a id="footnotetag264" name=
"footnotetag264"></a><a href="#footnote264"><sup>264</sup></a>.
Moreover, the scriptural passage, 'He is to be heard, to be
thought,' enjoins thought in addition to hearing, and thereby shows
that Reasoning also is to be resorted to with regard to Brahman.
Hence an objection founded on Reasoning is set forth, 'Not so, on
account of the difference of nature of this (effect).'&mdash;The
Ved&acirc;ntic opinion that the intelligent Brahman is the material
cause of this world is untenable because the effect would in that
case be of an altogether different character from the cause. For
this world, which the Ved&acirc;ntin considers as the effect of
Brahman, is perceived to be non-intelligent and impure,
consequently different in character from Brahman; and Brahman again
is declared by the sacred texts to be of a character different from
the world, viz. intelligent and pure. But things of an altogether
different character cannot stand to each other in the relation of
material cause and effect. Such effects, for instance, as golden
ornaments do not have earth for their material cause, nor is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page301" id=
"page301"></a>{301}</span> gold the material cause of earthen
vessels; but effects of an earthy nature originate from earth and
effects of the nature of gold from gold. In the same manner this
world, which is non-intelligent and comprises pleasure, pain, and
dulness, can only be the effect of a cause itself non-intelligent
and made up of pleasure, pain, and dulness; but not of Brahman
which is of an altogether different character. The difference in
character of this world from Brahman must be understood to be due
to its impurity and its want of intelligence. It is impure because
being itself made up of pleasure, pain, and dulness, it is the
cause of delight, grief, despondency, &amp;c., and because it
comprises in itself abodes of various character such as heaven,
hell, and so on. It is devoid of intelligence because it is
observed to stand to the intelligent principle in the relation of
subserviency, being the instrument of its activity. For the
relation of subserviency of one thing to another is not possible on
the basis of equality; two lamps, for instance, cannot be said to
be subservient to each other (both being equally
luminous).&mdash;But, it will be said, an intelligent instrument
also might be subservient to the enjoying soul; just as an
intelligent servant is subservient to his master.&mdash;This
analogy, we reply, does not hold good, because in the case of
servant and master also only the non-intelligent element in the
former is subservient to the intelligent master. For a being
endowed with intelligence subserves another intelligent being only
with the non-intelligent part belonging to it, viz. its internal
organ, sense organs, &amp;c.; while in so far as it is intelligent
itself it acts neither for nor against any other being. For the
S&acirc;@nkhyas are of opinion that the intelligent beings (i.e.
the souls) are incapable of either taking in or giving out
anything<a id="footnotetag265" name="footnotetag265"></a><a href=
"#footnote265"><sup>265</sup></a>, and are non-active. Hence that
only which is devoid of intelligence can be an instrument.
Nor<a id="footnotetag266" name="footnotetag266"></a><a href=
"#footnote266"><sup>266</sup></a> is there anything <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page302" id="page302"></a>{302}</span> to show
that things like pieces of wood and clods of earth are of an
intelligent nature; on the contrary, the dichotomy of all things
which exist into such as are intelligent and such as are
non-intelligent is well established. This world therefore cannot
have its material cause in Brahman from which it is altogether
different in character.&mdash;Here somebody might argue as follows.
Scripture tells us that this world has originated from an
intelligent cause; therefore, starting from the observation that
the attributes of the cause survive in the effect, I assume this
whole world to be intelligent. The absence of manifestation of
intelligence (in this world) is to be ascribed to the particular
nature of the modification<a id="footnotetag267" name=
"footnotetag267"></a><a href="#footnote267"><sup>267</sup></a>.
Just as undoubtedly intelligent beings do not manifest their
intelligence in certain states such as sleep, swoon, &amp;c., so
the intelligence of wood and earth also is not manifest (although
it exists). In consequence of this difference produced by the
manifestation and non-manifestation of intelligence (in the case of
men, animals, &amp;c., on the one side, and wood, stones, &amp;c.
on the other side), and in consequence of form, colour, and the
like being present in the one case and absent in the other, nothing
prevents the instruments of action (earth, wood, &amp;c.) from
standing to the souls in the relation of a subordinate to a
superior thing, although in reality both are equally of an
intelligent nature. And just as such substances as flesh, broth,
pap, and the like may, owing to their individual differences, stand
in the relation of mutual subserviency, although fundamentally they
are all of the same nature, viz. mere modifications of earth, so it
will be in the case under discussion also, without there being done
any violence to the well-known distinction (of beings intelligent
and non-intelligent).&mdash;This reasoning&mdash;the
p&ucirc;rvapakshin replies&mdash;if valid might remove to a certain
extent that difference of character between <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page303" id="page303"></a>{303}</span> Brahman
and the world which is due to the circumstance of the one being
intelligent and the other non-intelligent; there would, however,
still remain that other difference which results from the fact that
the one is pure and the other impure. But in reality the
argumentation of the objector does not even remove the first-named
difference; as is declared in the latter part of the S&ucirc;tra,
'And its being such we learn from Scripture.' For the assumption of
the intellectuality of the entire world&mdash;which is supported
neither by perception nor by inference, &amp;c.&mdash;must be
considered as resting on Scripture only in so far as the latter
speaks of the world as having originated from an intelligent cause;
but that scriptural statement itself is contradicted by other texts
which declare the world to be 'of such a nature,' i.e. of a nature
different from that of its material cause. For the scriptural
passage, 'It became that which is knowledge and that which is
devoid of knowledge' (Taitt. Up. II, 6), which teaches that a
certain class of beings is of a non-intelligent nature intimates
thereby that the non-intelligent world is different from the
intelligent Brahman.&mdash;But&mdash;somebody might again
object&mdash;the sacred texts themselves sometimes speak of the
elements and the bodily organs, which are generally considered to
be devoid of intelligence, as intelligent beings. The following
passages, for instance, attribute intelligence to the elements.
'The earth spoke;' 'The waters spoke' (<i>S</i>at. Br. VI, 1, 3, 2;
4); and, again, 'Fire thought;' 'Water thought' (Ch. Up. VI, 2, 3;
4). Other texts attribute intelligence to the bodily organs, 'These
pr&acirc;<i>n</i>as when quarrelling together as to who was the
best went to Brahman' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. VI, 1, 7); and, again, 'They
said to Speech: Do thou sing out for us' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. I, 3,
2).&mdash;To this objection the p&ucirc;rvapakshin replies in the
following S&ucirc;tra.</p>
<p>5. But (there takes place) denotation of the superintending
(deities), on account of the difference and the connexion.</p>
<p>The word 'but' discards the doubt raised. We are <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page304" id="page304"></a>{304}</span> not
entitled to base the assumption of the elements and the sense
organs being of an intellectual nature on such passages as 'the
earth spoke,' &amp;c. because 'there takes place denotation of that
which presides.' In the case of actions like speaking, disputing,
and so on, which require intelligence, the scriptural passages
denote not the mere material elements and organs, but rather the
intelligent divinities which preside over earth, &amp;c., on the
one hand, and Speech, &amp;c., on the other hand. And why so? 'On
account of the difference and the connexion.' The difference is the
one previously referred to between the enjoying souls, on the one
hand, and the material elements and organs, on the other hand,
which is founded on the distinction between intelligent and
non-intelligent beings; that difference would not be possible if
all beings were intelligent. Moreover, the Kaush&icirc;takins in
their account of the dispute of the pr&acirc;<i>n</i>as make
express use of the word 'divinities' in order to preclude the idea
of the mere material organs being meant, and in order to include
the superintending intelligent beings. They say, 'The deities
contending with each for who was the best;' and, again, 'All these
deities having recognised the pre-eminence in pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a'
(Kau. Up. II, 14).&mdash;And, secondly, Mantras, Arthav&acirc;das,
Itih&acirc;sas, Pur&acirc;<i>n</i>as, &amp;c. all declare that
intelligent presiding divinities are connected with everything.
Moreover, such scriptural passages as 'Agni having become Speech
entered into the mouth' (Ait. &Acirc;r. II, 4, 2, 4) show that each
bodily organ is connected with its own favouring divinity. And in
the passages supplementary to the quarrel of the
pr&acirc;<i>n</i>as we read in one place how, for the purpose of
settling their relative excellence, they went to Praj&acirc;pati,
and how they settled their quarrel on the ground of presence and
absence, each of them, as Praj&acirc;pati had advised, departing
from the body for some time ('They went to their father
Praj&acirc;pati and said,' &amp;c,; Ch. Up. V, 1, 7); and in
another place it is said that they made an offering to
pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a (B<i>ri</i>. Up. VI, 1, 13), &amp;c.; all of
them proceedings which are analogous to those of men, &amp;c., and
therefore strengthen the hypothesis that the text refers to the
superintending <span class="pagenum"><a name="page305" id=
"page305"></a>{305}</span> deities. In the case of such passages
as, 'Fire thought,' we must assume that the thought spoken of is
that of the highest deity which is connected with its effects as a
superintending principle.&mdash;From all this it follows that this
world is different in nature from Brahman, and hence cannot have it
for its material cause.</p>
<p>To this objection raised by the p&ucirc;rvapakshin the next
S&ucirc;tra replies.</p>
<p>6. But it is seen.</p>
<p>The word 'but' discards the p&ucirc;rvapaksha.</p>
<p>Your assertion that this world cannot have originated from
Brahman on account of the difference of its character is not
founded on an absolutely true tenet. For we see that from man, who
is acknowledged to be intelligent, non-intelligent things such as
hair and nails originate, and that, on the other hand, from
avowedly non-intelligent matter, such as cow-dung, scorpions and
similar animals are produced.&mdash;But&mdash;to state an
objection&mdash;the real cause of the non-intelligent hair and
nails is the human body which is itself non-intelligent, and the
non-intelligent bodies only of scorpions are the effects of
non-intelligent dung.&mdash;Even thus, we reply, there remains a
difference in character (between the cause, for instance, the dung,
and the effect, for instance, the body of the scorpion), in so far
as some non-intelligent matter (the body) is the abode of an
intelligent principle (the scorpion's soul), while other
non-intelligent matter (the dung) is not. Moreover, the difference
of nature&mdash;due to the cause passing over into the
effect&mdash;between the bodies of men on the one side and hair and
nails on the other side, is, on account of the divergence of
colour, form, &amp;c., very considerable after all. The same remark
holds good with regard to cow-dung and the bodies of scorpions,
&amp;c. If absolute equality were insisted on (in the case of one
thing being the effect of another), the relation of material cause
and effect (which after all requires a distinction of the two)
would be annihilated. If, again, it be remarked that in the case of
men and hair as well as in that of scorpions and <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page306" id="page306"></a>{306}</span> cow-dung
there is one characteristic feature, at least, which is found in
the effect as well as in the cause, viz. the quality of being of an
earthy nature; we reply that in the case of Brahman and the world
also one characteristic feature, viz. that of existence
(satt&acirc;), is found in ether, &amp;c. (which are the effects)
as well as in Brahman (which is the cause).&mdash;He, moreover, who
on the ground of the difference of the attributes tries to
invalidate the doctrine of Brahman being the cause of the world,
must assert that he understands by difference of attributes either
the non-occurrence (in the world) of the entire complex of the
characteristics of Brahman, or the non-occurrence of any (some or
other) characteristic, or the non-occurrence of the characteristic
of intelligence. The first assertion would lead to the negation of
the relation of cause and effect in general, which relation is
based on the fact of there being in the effect something over and
above the cause (for if the two were absolutely identical they
could not be distinguished). The second assertion is open to the
charge of running counter to what is well known; for, as we have
already remarked, the characteristic quality of existence which
belongs to Brahman is found likewise in ether and so on. For the
third assertion the requisite proving instances are wanting; for
what instances could be brought forward against the upholder of
Brahman, in order to prove the general assertion that whatever is
devoid of intelligence is seen not to be an effect of Brahman? (The
upholder of Brahman would simply not admit any such instances)
because he maintains that this entire complex of things has Brahman
for its material cause. And that all such assertions are contrary
to Scripture, is clear, as we have already shown it to be the
purport of Scripture that Brahman is the cause and substance of the
world. It has indeed been maintained by the p&ucirc;rvapakshin that
the other means of proof also (and not merely sacred tradition)
apply to Brahman, on account of its being an accomplished entity
(not something to be accomplished as religious duties are); but
such an assertion is entirely gratuitous. For Brahman, as being
devoid of form and so on, cannot become an object of <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page307" id="page307"></a>{307}</span>
perception; and as there are in its case no characteristic marks
(on which conclusions, &amp;c. might be based), inference also and
the other means of proof do not apply to it; but, like religious
duty, it is to be known solely on the ground of holy tradition.
Thus Scripture also declares, 'That doctrine is not to be obtained
by argument, but when it is declared by another then, O dearest! it
is easy to understand' (Ka. Up. I, 2, 9). And again, 'Who in truth
knows it? Who could here proclaim it, whence this creation sprang?'
(<i>Ri</i>g-v. Sa<i>m</i>h. X, 129, 6). These two mantras show that
the cause of this world is not to be known even by divine beings
(&icirc;<i>s</i>vara)<a id="footnotetag268" name=
"footnotetag268"></a><a href="#footnote268"><sup>268</sup></a> of
extraordinary power and wisdom.</p>
<p>There are also the following Sm<i>ri</i>ti passages to the same
effect: 'Do not apply reasoning to those things which are
uncognisable<a id="footnotetag269" name=
"footnotetag269"></a><a href="#footnote269"><sup>269</sup></a>;'
'Unevolved he is called, uncognisable, unchangeable;' 'Not the
legions of the gods know my origin, not the great <i>ri</i>shis.
For I myself am in every way the origin of the gods and great
<i>ri</i>shis' (Bha. G&icirc;. X, 2).&mdash;And if it has been
maintained above that the scriptural passage enjoining thought (on
Brahman) in addition to mere hearing (of the sacred texts treating
of Brahman) shows that reasoning also is to be allowed its place,
we reply that the passage must not deceitfully be taken as
enjoining bare independent ratiocination, but must be understood to
represent reasoning as a subordinate auxiliary of intuitional
knowledge. By reasoning of the latter type we may, for instance,
arrive at the following conclusions; that because the state of
dream and the waking state exclude each other the Self is not
connected with those states; that, as the soul in the state of deep
sleep leaves the phenomenal world behind and becomes one with that
whose Self is pure Being, it has for its Self pure Being apart from
the phenomenal world; that as the world springs from Brahman it
cannot be separate from Brahman, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page308" id="page308"></a>{308}</span> according to the principle
of the non-difference of cause and effect, &amp;c.<a id=
"footnotetag270" name="footnotetag270"></a><a href=
"#footnote270"><sup>270</sup></a> The fallaciousness of mere
reasoning will moreover be demonstrated later on (II, 1,
11).&mdash;He<a id="footnotetag271" name=
"footnotetag271"></a><a href="#footnote271"><sup>271</sup></a>,
moreover, who merely on the ground of the sacred tradition about an
intelligent cause of the world would assume this entire world to be
of an intellectual nature would find room for the other scriptural
passage quoted above ('He became knowledge and what is devoid of
knowledge') which teaches a distinction of intellect and
non-intellect; for he could avail himself of the doctrine of
intellect being sometimes manifested and sometimes non-manifested.
His antagonist, on the other hand (i.e. the S&acirc;@nkhya), would
not be able to make anything of the passage, for it distinctly
teaches that the highest cause constitutes the Self of the entire
world.</p>
<p>If, then, on account of difference of character that which is
intelligent cannot pass over into what is non-intelligent, that
also which is non-intelligent (i.e. in our case, the
non-intelligent pradh&acirc;na of the S&acirc;@nkhyas) cannot pass
over into what is intelligent.&mdash;(So much for argument's sake,)
but apart from that, as the argument resting on difference of
character has already been refuted, we must assume an intelligent
cause of the world in agreement with Scripture.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page309" id=
"page309"></a>{309}</span>
<p>7. If (it is said that the effect is) non-existent (before its
origination); we do not allow that because it is a mere negation
(without an object).</p>
<p>If Brahman, which is intelligent, pure, and devoid of qualities
such as sound, and so on, is supposed to be the cause of an effect
which is of an opposite nature, i.e. non-intelligent, impure,
possessing the qualities of sound, &amp;c., it follows that the
effect has to be considered as non-existing before its actual
origination. But this consequence cannot be acceptable to
you&mdash;the Ved&acirc;ntin&mdash;who maintain the doctrine of the
effect existing in the cause already.</p>
<p>This objection of yours, we reply, is without any force, on
account of its being a mere negation. If you negative the existence
of the effect previous to its actual origination, your negation is
a mere negation without an object to be negatived. The negation
(implied in 'non-existent') can certainly not have for its object
the existence of the effect previous to its origination, since the
effect must be viewed as 'existent,' through and in the Self of the
cause, before its origination as well as after it; for at the
present moment also this effect does not exist independently, apart
from the cause; according to such scriptural passages as,
'Whosoever looks for anything elsewhere than in the Self is
abandoned by everything' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. II, 4, 6). In so far, on
the other hand, as the effect exists through the Self of the cause,
its existence is the same before the actual beginning of the effect
(as after it).&mdash;But Brahman, which is devoid of qualities such
as sound, &amp;c., is the cause of this world (possessing all those
qualities)!&mdash;True, but the effect with all its qualities does
not exist without the Self of the cause either now or before the
actual beginning (of the effect); hence it cannot be said that
(according to our doctrine) the effect is non-existing before its
actual beginning.&mdash;This point will be elucidated in detail in
the section treating of the non-difference of cause and effect.</p>
<p>8. On account of such consequences at the time <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page310" id="page310"></a>{310}</span> of
reabsorption (the doctrine maintained hitherto) is
objectionable.</p>
<p>The p&ucirc;rvapakshin raises further objections.&mdash;If an
effect which is distinguished by the qualities of grossness,
consisting of parts, absence of intelligence, limitation, impurity,
&amp;c., is admitted to have Brahman for its cause, it follows that
at the time of reabsorption (of the world into Brahman), the
effect, by entering into the state of non-division from its cause,
inquinates the latter with its properties. As therefore&mdash;on
your doctrine&mdash;the cause (i.e. Brahman) as well as the effect
is, at the time of reabsorption, characterised by impurity and
similar qualities, the doctrine of the Upanishads, according to
which an omniscient Brahman is the cause of the world, cannot be
upheld.&mdash;Another objection to that doctrine is that in
consequence of all distinctions passing at the time of reabsorption
into the state of non-distinction there would be no special causes
left at the time of a new beginning of the world, and consequently
the new world could not arise with all the distinctions of enjoying
souls, objects to be enjoyed and so on (which are actually observed
to exist).&mdash;A third objection is that, if we assume the origin
of a new world even after the annihilation of all works, &amp;c.
(which are the causes of a new world arising) of the enjoying souls
which enter into the state of non-difference from the highest
Brahman, we are led to the conclusion that also those (souls) which
have obtained final release again appear in the new world.&mdash;If
you finally say, 'Well, let this world remain distinct from the
highest Brahman even at the time of reabsorption,' we reply that in
that case a reabsorption will not take place at all, and that,
moreover, the effect's existing separate from the cause is not
possible.&mdash;For all these reasons the Ved&acirc;nta doctrine is
objectionable.</p>
<p>To this the next S&ucirc;tra replies.</p>
<p>9. Not so; as there are parallel instances.</p>
<p>There is nothing objectionable in our system.&mdash;The
objection that the effect when being reabsorbed into its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page311" id=
"page311"></a>{311}</span> cause would inquinate the latter with
its qualities does not damage our position 'because there are
parallel instances,' i.e. because there are instances of effects
not inquinating with their qualities the causes into which they are
reabsorbed. Things, for instance, made of clay, such as pots,
&amp;c., which in their state of separate existence are of various
descriptions, do not, when they are reabsorbed into their original
matter (i.e. clay), impart to the latter their individual
qualities; nor do golden ornaments impart their individual
qualities to their elementary material, i.e. gold, into which they
may finally be reabsorbed. Nor does the fourfold complex of organic
beings which springs from earth impart its qualities to the latter
at the time of reabsorption. You (i.e. the p&ucirc;rvapakshin), on
the other hand, have not any instances to quote in your favour. For
reabsorption could not take place at all if the effect when passing
back into its causal substance continued to subsist there with all
its individual properties. And<a id="footnotetag272" name=
"footnotetag272"></a><a href="#footnote272"><sup>272</sup></a> that
in spite of the non-difference of cause and effect the effect has
its Self in the cause, but not the cause in the effect, is a point
which we shall render clear later on, under II, 1, 14.</p>
<p>Moreover, the objection that the effect would impart its
qualities to the cause at the time of reabsorption is formulated
too narrowly because, the identity of cause and effect being
admitted, the same would take place during the time of the
subsistence (of the effect, previous to its reabsorption). That the
identity of cause and effect (of Brahman and the world) holds good
indiscriminately with regard to all time (not only the time of
reabsorption), is declared in many scriptural passages, as, for
instance, 'This everything is that Self' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. II, 4,
6); 'The Self is all this' (Ch. Up. VII, 25, 2); 'The immortal
Brahman is this before' (Mu. Up. II, 2, 11); 'All this is Brahman'
(Ch. Up. III, 14, 1).</p>
<p>With regard to the case referred to in the <i>S</i>ruti-passages
we refute the assertion of the cause being affected by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page312" id=
"page312"></a>{312}</span> effect and its qualities by showing that
the latter are the mere fallacious superimpositions of nescience,
and the very same argument holds good with reference to
reabsorption also.&mdash;We can quote other examples in favour of
our doctrine. As the magician is not at any time affected by the
magical illusion produced by himself, because it is unreal, so the
highest Self is not affected by the world-illusion. And as one
dreaming person is not affected by the illusory visions of his
dream because they do not accompany the waking state and the state
of dreamless sleep; so the one permanent witness of the three
states (viz. the highest Self which is the one unchanging witness
of the creation, subsistence, and reabsorption of the world) is not
touched by the mutually exclusive three states. For that the
highest Self appears in those three states, is a mere illusion, not
more substantial than the snake for which the rope is mistaken in
the twilight. With reference to this point teachers knowing the
true tradition of the Ved&acirc;nta have made the following
declaration, 'When the individual soul which is held in the bonds
of slumber by the beginningless M&acirc;y&acirc; awakes, then it
knows the eternal, sleepless, dreamless non-duality'
(Gau<i>d</i>ap. K&acirc;r. I, 16).</p>
<p>So far we have shown that&mdash;on our doctrine&mdash;there is
no danger of the cause being affected at the time of reabsorption
by the qualities of the effect, such as grossness and the
like.&mdash;With regard to the second objection, viz. that if we
assume all distinctions to pass (at the time of reabsorption) into
the state of non-distinction there would be no special reason for
the origin of a new world affected with distinctions, we likewise
refer to the 'existence of parallel instances.' For the case is
parallel to that of deep sleep and trance. In those states also the
soul enters into an essential condition of non-distinction;
nevertheless, wrong knowledge being not yet finally overcome, the
old state of distinction re-establishes itself as soon as the soul
awakes from its sleep or trance. Compare the scriptural passage,
'All these creatures when they have become merged in the True, know
not that they are merged in the True. Whatever these creatures are
here, whether a lion, or a <span class="pagenum"><a name="page313"
id="page313"></a>{313}</span> wolf, or a boar, or a worm, or a
midge, or a gnat, or a mosquito, that they become again' (Ch. Up.
VI, 9, 2; 3) For just as during the subsistence of the world the
phenomenon of multifarious distinct existence, based on wrong
knowledge, proceeds unimpeded like the vision of a dream, although
there is only one highest Self devoid of all distinction; so, we
conclude, there remains, even after reabsorption, the power of
distinction (potential distinction) founded on wrong
knowledge.&mdash;Herewith the objection that&mdash;according to our
doctrine&mdash;even the finally released souls would be born again
is already disposed of. They will not be born again because in
their case wrong knowledge has been entirely discarded by perfect
knowledge.&mdash;The last alternative finally (which the
p&ucirc;rvapakshin had represented as open to the Ved&acirc;ntin),
viz. that even at the time of reabsorption the world should remain
distinct from Brahman, precludes itself because it is not admitted
by the Ved&acirc;ntins themselves.&mdash;Hence the system founded
on the Upanishads is in every way unobjectionable.</p>
<p>10. And because the objections (raised by the S&acirc;@nkhya
against the Ved&acirc;nta doctrine) apply to his view also.</p>
<p>The doctrine of our opponent is liable to the very same
objections which he urges against us, viz. in the following
manner.&mdash;The objection that this world cannot have sprung from
Brahman on account of its difference of character applies no less
to the doctrine of the pradh&acirc;na being the cause of the world;
for that doctrine also assumes that from a pradh&acirc;na devoid of
sound and other qualities a world is produced which possesses those
very qualities. The beginning of an effect different in character
being thus admitted, the S&acirc;@nkhya is equally driven to the
doctrine that before the actual beginning the effect was
non-existent. And, moreover, it being admitted (by the
S&acirc;@nkhya also) that at the time of reabsorption the effect
passes back into the state of non-distinction from the cause, the
case of the S&acirc;@nkhya here also is the same as
ours.&mdash;And, further, if <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page314" id="page314"></a>{314}</span> (as the S&acirc;@nkhya also
must admit) at the time of reabsorption the differences of all the
special effects are obliterated and pass into a state of general
non-distinction, the special fixed conditions, which previous to
reabsorption were the causes of the different worldly existence of
each soul, can, at the time of a new creation, no longer be
determined, there being no cause for them; and if you assume them
to be determined without a cause, you are driven to the admission
that even the released souls have to re-enter a state of bondage,
there being equal absence of a cause (in the case of the released
and the non-released souls). And if you try to avoid this
conclusion by assuming that at the time of reabsorption some
individual differences pass into the state of non-distinction,
others not, we reply that in that case the latter could not be
considered as effects of the pradh&acirc;na<a id="footnotetag273"
name="footnotetag273"></a><a href=
"#footnote273"><sup>273</sup></a>.&mdash;It thus appears that all
those difficulties (raised by the S&acirc;@nkhya) apply to both
views, and cannot therefore be urged against either only. But as
either of the two doctrines must necessarily be accepted, we are
strengthened&mdash;by the outcome of the above discussion&mdash;in
the opinion that the alleged difficulties are no real
difficulties<a id="footnotetag274" name=
"footnotetag274"></a><a href="#footnote274"><sup>274</sup></a>.</p>
<p>11. If it be said that, in consequence of the ill-foundedness of
reasoning, we must frame our conclusions otherwise; (we reply that)
thus also there would result non-release.</p>
<p>In matters to be known from Scripture mere reasoning is not to
be relied on for the following reason also. As the thoughts of man
are altogether unfettered, reasoning which disregards the holy
texts and rests on individual opinion only has no proper
foundation. We see how arguments, which some clever men had
excogitated with great pains, are shown, by people still more
ingenious, to be fallacious, and how the arguments of the latter
again are refuted in their turn <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page315" id="page315"></a>{315}</span> by other men; so that, on
account of the diversity of men's opinions, it is impossible to
accept mere reasoning as having a sure foundation. Nor can we get
over this difficulty by accepting as well-founded the reasoning of
some person of recognised mental eminence, may he now be Kapila or
anybody else; since we observe that even men of the most undoubted
mental eminence, such as Kapila, Ka<i>n</i>&acirc;da, and other
founders of philosophical schools, have contradicted one
another.</p>
<p>But (our adversary may here be supposed to say), we will fashion
our reasoning otherwise, i.e. in such a manner as not to lay it
open to the charge of having no proper foundation. You cannot,
after all, maintain that no reasoning whatever is well-founded; for
you yourself can found your assertion that reasoning has no
foundation on reasoning only; your assumption being that because
some arguments are seen to be devoid of foundation other arguments
as belonging to the same class are likewise devoid of foundation.
Moreover, if all reasoning were unfounded, the whole course of
practical human life would have to come to an end. For we see that
men act, with a view to obtaining pleasure and avoiding pain in the
future time, on the assumption that the past, the present, and the
future are uniform.&mdash;Further, in the case of passages of
Scripture (apparently) contradicting each other, the ascertainment
of the real sense, which depends on a preliminary refutation of the
apparent sense, can be effected only by an accurate definition of
the meaning of sentences, and that involves a process of reasoning.
Thus Manu also expresses himself: 'Perception, inference, and the
<i>s</i>&acirc;stra according to the various traditions, this triad
is to be known well by one desiring clearness in regard to
right.&mdash;He who applies reasoning not contradicted by the Veda
to the Veda and the (Sm<i>ri</i>ti) doctrine of law, he, and no
other, knows the law' (Manu Sm<i>ri</i>ti XII, 105, 106). And that
'want of foundation', to which you object, really constitutes the
beauty of reasoning, because it enables us to arrive at
unobjectionable arguments by means of the previous refutation of
objectionable arguments<a id="footnotetag275" name=
"footnotetag275"></a><a href="#footnote275"><sup>275</sup></a>. (No
fear that because the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page316" id=
"page316"></a>{316}</span> p&ucirc;rvapaksha is ill-founded the
siddh&acirc;nta should be ill-founded too;) for there is no valid
reason to maintain that a man must be stupid because his elder
brother was stupid.&mdash;For all these reasons the want of
foundation cannot be used as an argument against reasoning.</p>
<p>Against this argumentation we remark that thus also there
results 'want of release.' For although with regard to some things
reasoning is observed to be well founded, with regard to the matter
in hand there will result 'want of release,' viz. of the reasoning
from this very fault of ill-foundedness. The true nature of the
cause of the world on which final emancipation depends cannot, on
account of its excessive abstruseness, even be thought of without
the help of the holy texts; for, as already remarked, it cannot
become the object of perception, because it does not possess
qualities such as form and the like, and as it is devoid of
characteristic signs, it does not lend itself to inference and the
other means of right knowledge.&mdash;Or else (if we adopt another
explanation of the word 'avimoksha') all those who teach the final
release of the soul are agreed that it results from perfect
knowledge. Perfect knowledge has the characteristic mark of
uniformity, because it depends on accomplished actually existing
things; for whatever thing is permanently of one and the same
nature is acknowledged to be a true or real thing, and knowledge
conversant about such is called perfect knowledge; as, for
instance, the knowledge embodied in the proposition, 'fire is hot.'
Now, it is clear that in the case of perfect knowledge a mutual
conflict of men's opinions is impossible. But that cognitions
founded on reasoning do conflict is generally known; for we
continually observe that what one logician endeavours to establish
as perfect knowledge is demolished by another, who, in his turn, is
treated alike by a third. How therefore can knowledge, which is
founded on reasoning, and whose object is not something permanently
uniform, be perfect knowledge?&mdash;Nor can it be said that he who
maintains the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page317" id=
"page317"></a>{317}</span> pradh&acirc;na to be the cause of the
world (i.e. the S&acirc;@nkhya) is the best of all reasoners, and
accepted as such by all philosophers; which would enable us to
accept his opinion as perfect knowledge.&mdash;Nor can we collect
at a given moment and on a given spot all the logicians of the
past, present, and future time, so as to settle (by their
agreement) that their opinion regarding some uniform object is to
be considered perfect knowledge. The Veda, on the other hand, which
is eternal and the source of knowledge, may be allowed to have for
its object firmly established things, and hence the perfection of
that knowledge which is founded on the Veda cannot be denied by any
of the logicians of the past, present, or future. We have thus
established the perfection of this our knowledge which reposes on
the Upanishads, and as apart from it perfect knowledge is
impossible, its disregard would lead to 'absence of final release'
of the transmigrating souls. Our final position therefore is, that
on the ground of Scripture and of reasoning subordinate to
Scripture, the intelligent Brahman is to be considered the cause
and substance of the world.</p>
<p>12. Thereby those (theories) also which are not accepted by
competent persons are explained.</p>
<p>Hitherto we have refuted those objections against the
Ved&acirc;nta-texts which, based on reasoning, take their stand on
the doctrine of the pradh&acirc;na being the cause of the world;
(which doctrine deserves to be refuted first), because it stands
near to our Vedic system, is supported by somewhat weighty
arguments, and has, to a certain extent, been adopted by some
authorities who follow the Veda.&mdash;But now some dull-witted
persons might think that another objection founded on reasoning
might be raised against the Ved&acirc;nta, viz. on the ground of
the atomic doctrine. The S&ucirc;trak&acirc;ra, therefore, extends
to the latter objection the refutation of the former, considering
that by the conquest of the most dangerous adversary the conquest
of the minor enemies is already virtually accomplished. Other
doctrines, as, for instance, the atomic doctrine of which no part
has been accepted by <span class="pagenum"><a name="page318" id=
"page318"></a>{318}</span> either Manu or Vy&acirc;sa or other
authorities, are to be considered as 'explained,' i.e. refuted by
the same reasons which enabled us to dispose of the pradh&acirc;na
doctrine. As the reasons on which the refutation hinges are the
same, there is no room for further doubt. Such common arguments are
the impotence of reasoning to fathom the depth of the
transcendental cause of the world, the ill-foundedness of mere
Reasoning, the impossibility of final release, even in case of the
conclusions being shaped 'otherwise' (see the preceding
S&ucirc;tra), the conflict of Scripture and Reasoning, and so
on.</p>
<p>13. If it be said that from the circumstance of (the objects of
enjoyment) passing over into the enjoyer (and vice vers&acirc;)
there would result non-distinction (of the two); we reply that
(such distinction) may exist (nevertheless), as ordinary experience
shows.</p>
<p>Another objection, based on reasoning, is raised against the
doctrine of Brahman being the cause of the world.&mdash;Although
Scripture is authoritative with regard to its own special
subject-matter (as, for instance, the causality of Brahman), still
it may have to be taken in a secondary sense in those cases where
the subject-matter is taken out of its grasp by other means of
right knowledge; just as mantras and arthav&acirc;das have
occasionally to be explained in a secondary sense (when the
primary, literal sense is rendered impossible by other means of
right knowledge<a id="footnotetag276" name=
"footnotetag276"></a><a href="#footnote276"><sup>276</sup></a>).
Analogously reasoning is to be considered invalid outside its
legitimate sphere; so, for instance, in the case of religious duty
and its opposite<a id="footnotetag277" name=
"footnotetag277"></a><a href=
"#footnote277"><sup>277</sup></a>.&mdash;Hence Scripture cannot be
acknowledged to refute what is settled by other means of right
knowledge. And if you ask, 'Where does Scripture oppose itself to
what is thus established?' we give you the following <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page319" id="page319"></a>{319}</span> instance.
The distinction of enjoyers and objects of enjoyment is well known
from ordinary experience, the enjoyers being intelligent, embodied
souls, while sound and the like are the objects of enjoyment.
Devadatta, for instance, is an enjoyer, the dish (which he eats) an
object of enjoyment. The distinction of the two would be reduced to
non-existence if the enjoyer passed over into the object of
enjoyment, and vice vers&acirc;. Now this passing over of one thing
into another would actually result from the doctrine of the world
being non-different from Brahman. But the sublation of a
well-established distinction is objectionable, not only with regard
to the present time when that distinction is observed to exist, but
also with regard to the past and the future, for which it is
inferred. The doctrine of Brahman's causality must therefore be
abandoned, as it would lead to the sublation of the
well-established distinction of enjoyers and objects of
enjoyment.</p>
<p>To the preceding objection we reply, 'It may exist as in
ordinary experience.' Even on our philosophic view the distinction
may exist, as ordinary experience furnishes us with analogous
instances. We see, for instance, that waves, foam, bubbles, and
other modifications of the sea, although they really are not
different from the sea-water, exist, sometimes in the state of
mutual separation, sometimes in the state of conjunction, &amp;c.
From the fact of their being non-different from the sea-water, it
does not follow that they pass over into each other; and, again,
although they do not pass over into each other, still they are not
different from the sea. So it is in the case under discussion also.
The enjoyers and the objects of enjoyment do not pass over into
each other, and yet they are not different from the highest
Brahman. And although the enjoyer is not really an effect of
Brahman, since the unmodified creator himself, in so far as he
enters into the effect, is called the enjoyer (according to the
passage, 'Having created he entered into it,' Taitt. Up. II, 6),
still after Brahman has entered into its effects it passes into a
state of distinction, in consequence of the effect acting as a
limiting adjunct; just as the universal ether is divided by its
contact with jars and other limiting <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page320" id="page320"></a>{320}</span> adjuncts. The conclusion
is, that the distinction of enjoyers and objects of enjoyment is
possible, although both are non-different from Brahman, their
highest cause, as the analogous instance of the sea and its waves
demonstrates.</p>
<p>14. The non-difference of them (i.e. of cause and effect)
results from such terms as 'origin' and the like.</p>
<p>The<a id="footnotetag278" name="footnotetag278"></a><a href=
"#footnote278"><sup>278</sup></a> refutation contained in the
preceding S&ucirc;tra was set forth on the condition of the
practical distinction of enjoyers and objects of enjoyment being
acknowledged. In reality, however, that distinction does not exist
because there is understood to be non-difference (identity) of
cause and effect. The effect is this manifold world consisting of
ether and so on; the cause is the highest Brahman. Of the effect it
is understood that in reality it is non-different from the cause,
i.e. has no existence apart from the cause.&mdash;How so?&mdash;'On
account of the scriptural word "origin" and others.' The word
'origin' is used in connexion with a simile, in a passage
undertaking to show how through the knowledge of one thing
everthing is known; viz. Ch. Up. VI, 1, 4, 'As, my dear, by one
clod of clay all that is made of clay is known, the modification
(i.e. the effect; the thing made of clay) being a name merely which
has its origin in speech, while the truth is that it is clay
merely; thus,' &amp;c.&mdash;The meaning of this passage is that,
if there is known a lump of clay which really and truly is nothing
but clay<a id="footnotetag279" name="footnotetag279"></a><a href=
"#footnote279"><sup>279</sup></a>, there are known thereby likewise
all things made of clay, such as jars, dishes, pails, and so on,
all of which agree in having clay for their true nature. For these
modifications or effects are names only, exist through or originate
from speech only, while in reality there exists no such thing as a
modification. In so far as they are names (individual effects
distinguished by names) they are untrue; in so far <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page321" id="page321"></a>{321}</span> as they
are clay they are true.&mdash;This parallel instance is given with
reference to Brahman; applying the phrase 'having its origin in
speech' to the case illustrated by the instance quoted we
understand that the entire body of effects has no existence apart
from Brahman.&mdash;Later on again the text, after having declared
that fire, water, and earth are the effects of Brahman, maintains
that the effects of these three elements have no existence apart
from them, 'Thus has vanished the specific nature of burning fire,
the modification being a mere name which has its origin in speech,
while only the three colours are what is true' (Ch. Up. VI, 4,
1).&mdash;Other sacred texts also whose purport it is to intimate
the unity of the Self are to be quoted here, in accordance with the
'and others' of the S&ucirc;tra. Such texts are, 'In that all this
has its Self; it is the True, it is the Self, thou art that' (Ch.
Up. VI, 8, 7); 'This everything, all is that Self' (<i>Bri</i>. Up.
II, 4, 6); 'Brahman alone is all this' (Mu. Up. II, 2, 11); 'The
Self is all this' (Ch. Up. VII, 25, 2); 'There is in it no
diversity' (Bri. Up. IV, 4, 25).&mdash;On any other assumption it
would not be possible to maintain that by the knowledge of one
thing everything becomes known (as the text quoted above declares).
We therefore must adopt the following view. In the same way as
those parts of ethereal space which are limited by jars and
waterpots are not really different from the universal ethereal
space, and as the water of a mirage is not really different from
the surface of the salty steppe&mdash;for the nature of that water
is that it is seen in one moment and has vanished in the next, and
moreover, it is not to be perceived by its own nature (i.e. apart
from the surface of the desert<a id="footnotetag280" name=
"footnotetag280"></a><a href=
"#footnote280"><sup>280</sup></a>)&mdash;; so this manifold world
with its objects of enjoyment, enjoyers and so on has no existence
apart from Brahman.&mdash;But&mdash;it might be
objected&mdash;Brahman has in itself elements of manifoldness. As
the tree has many branches, so Brahman possesses many powers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page322" id=
"page322"></a>{322}</span> and energies dependent on those powers.
Unity and manifoldness are therefore both true. Thus, a tree
considered in itself is one, but it is manifold if viewed as having
branches; so the sea in itself is one, but manifold as having waves
and foam; so the clay in itself is one, but manifold if viewed with
regard to the jars and dishes made of it. On this assumption the
process of final release resulting from right knowledge may be
established in connexion with the element of unity (in Brahman),
while the two processes of common worldly activity and of activity
according to the Veda&mdash;which depend on the
karmak&acirc;<i>nd</i>a&mdash;may be established in connexion with
the element of manifoldness. And with this view the parallel
instances of clay &amp;c. agree very well.</p>
<p>This theory, we reply, is untenable because in the instance
(quoted in the Upanishad) the phrase 'as clay they are true'
asserts the cause only to be true while the phrase 'having its
origin in speech' declares the unreality of all effects. And with
reference to the matter illustrated by the instance given (viz. the
highest cause, Brahman) we read, 'In that all this has its Self;'
and, again, 'That is true;' whereby it is asserted that only the
one highest cause is true. The following passage again, 'That is
the Self; thou art that, O <i>S</i>vetaketu!' teaches that the
embodied soul (the individual soul) also is Brahman. (And we must
note that) the passage distinctly teaches that the fact of the
embodied soul having its Self in Brahman is self-established, not
to be accomplished by endeavour. This doctrine of the individual
soul having its Self in Brahman, if once accepted as the doctrine
of the Veda, does away with the independent existence of the
individual soul, just as the idea of the rope does away with the
idea of the snake (for which the rope had been mistaken). And if
the doctrine of the independent existence of the individual soul
has to be set aside, then the opinion of the entire phenomenal
world&mdash;which is based on the individual soul&mdash;having an
independent existence is likewise to be set aside. But only for the
establishment of the latter an element of manifoldness would have
to be assumed in Brahman, in <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page323" id="page323"></a>{323}</span> addition to the element of
unity.&mdash;Scriptural passages also (such as, 'When the Self only
is all this, how should he see another?' B<i>ri</i>. Up. II, 4, 13)
declare that for him who sees that everything has its Self in
Brahman the whole phenomenal world with its actions, agents, and
results of actions is non-existent. Nor can it be said that this
non-existence of the phenomenal world is declared (by Scripture) to
be limited to certain states; for the passage 'Thou art that' shows
that the general fact of Brahman being the Self of all is not
limited by any particular state. Moreover, Scripture, showing by
the instance of the thief (Ch. VI, 16) that the false-minded is
bound while the true-minded is released, declares thereby that
unity is the one true existence while manifoldness is evolved out
of wrong knowledge. For if both were true how could the man who
acquiesces in the reality of this phenomenal world be called
false-minded<a id="footnotetag281" name=
"footnotetag281"></a><a href="#footnote281"><sup>281</sup></a>?
Another scriptural passage ('from death to death goes he who
perceives therein any diversity,' B<i>ri</i>. Up. IV, 4, 19)
declares the same, by blaming those who perceive any
distinction.&mdash;Moreover, on the doctrine, which we are at
present impugning, release cannot result from knowledge, because
the doctrine does not acknowledge that some kind of wrong
knowledge, to be removed by perfect knowledge, is the cause of the
phenomenal world. For how can the cognition of unity remove the
cognition of manifoldness if both are true?</p>
<p>Other objections are started.&mdash;If we acquiesce in the
doctrine of absolute unity, the ordinary means of right knowledge,
perception, &amp;c., become invalid because the absence of
manifoldness deprives them of their objects; just as the idea of a
man becomes invalid after the right idea of the post (which at
first had been mistaken for a man) has presented itself. Moreover,
all the texts embodying injunctions and prohibitions will lose
their purport if the distinction on which their validity depends
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page324" id=
"page324"></a>{324}</span> does not really exist. And further, the
entire body of doctrine which refers to final release will
collapse, if the distinction of teacher and pupil on which it
depends is not real. And if the doctrine of release is untrue, how
can we maintain the truth of the absolute unity of the Self, which
forms an item of that doctrine?</p>
<p>These objections, we reply, do not damage our position because
the entire complex of phenomenal existence is considered as true as
long as the knowledge of Brahman being the Self of all has not
arisen; just as the phantoms of a dream are considered to be true
until the sleeper wakes. For as long as a person has not reached
the true knowledge of the unity of the Self, so long it does not
enter his mind that the world of effects with its means and objects
of right knowledge and its results of actions is untrue; he rather,
in consequence of his ignorance, looks on mere effects (such as
body, offspring, wealth, &amp;c.) as forming part of and belonging
to his Self, forgetful of Brahman being in reality the Self of all.
Hence, as long as true knowledge does not present itself, there is
no reason why the ordinary course of secular and religious activity
should not hold on undisturbed. The case is analogous to that of a
dreaming man who in his dream sees manifold things, and, up to the
moment of waking, is convinced that his ideas are produced by real
perception without suspecting the perception to be a merely
apparent one.&mdash;But how (to restate an objection raised above)
can the Ved&acirc;nta-texts if untrue convey information about the
true being of Brahman? We certainly do not observe that a man
bitten by a rope-snake (i.e. a snake falsely imagined in a rope)
dies, nor is the water appearing in a mirage used for drinking or
bathing<a id="footnotetag282" name="footnotetag282"></a><a href=
"#footnote282"><sup>282</sup></a>.&mdash;This objection, we reply,
is without force (because as a matter of fact we do see real
effects to result from unreal causes), for we observe that death
sometimes takes place from imaginary venom, (when a man imagines
himself to have been bitten by a venomous snake,) <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page325" id="page325"></a>{325}</span> and
effects (of what is perceived in a dream) such as the bite of a
snake or bathing in a river take place with regard to a dreaming
person.&mdash;But, it will be said, these effects themselves are
unreal!&mdash;These effects themselves, we reply, are unreal
indeed; but not so the consciousness which the dreaming person has
of them. This consciousness is a real result; for it is not
sublated by the waking consciousness. The man who has risen from
sleep does indeed consider the effects perceived by him in his
dream such as being bitten by a snake, bathing in a river, &amp;c.
to be unreal, but he does not on that account consider the
consciousness he had of them to be unreal likewise.&mdash;(We
remark in passing that) by this fact of the consciousness of the
dreaming person not being sublated (by the waking consciousness)
the doctrine of the body being our true Self is to be considered as
refuted<a id="footnotetag283" name="footnotetag283"></a><a href=
"#footnote283"><sup>283</sup></a>.&mdash;Scripture also (in the
passage, 'If a man who is engaged in some sacrifice undertaken for
some special wish sees in his dream a woman, he is to infer
therefrom success in his work') declares that by the unreal phantom
of a dream a real result such as prosperity may be obtained. And,
again, another scriptural passage, after having declared that from
the observation of certain unfavourable omens a man is to conclude
that he will not live long, continues 'if somebody sees in his
dream a black man with black teeth and that man kills him,'
intimating thereby that by the unreal dream-phantom a real fact,
viz. death, is notified.&mdash;It is, moreover, known from the
experience of persons who carefully observe positive and negative
instances that such and such dreams are auspicious omens, others
the reverse. And (to quote another example that something true can
result from or be known through something untrue) we see that the
knowledge of the real sounds A. &amp;c. is reached by means of the
unreal written letters. Moreover, the reasons which establish the
unity of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page326" id=
"page326"></a>{326}</span> Self are altogether final, so that
subsequently to them nothing more is required for full
satisfaction<a id="footnotetag284" name=
"footnotetag284"></a><a href="#footnote284"><sup>284</sup></a>. An
injunction as, for instance, 'He is to sacrifice' at once renders
us desirous of knowing what is to be effected, and by what means
and in what manner it is to be effected; but passages such as,
'Thou art that,' 'I am Brahman,' leave nothing to be desired
because the state of consciousness produced by them has for its
object the unity of the universal Self. For as long as something
else remains a desire is possible; but there is nothing else which
could be desired in addition to the absolute unity of Brahman. Nor
can it be maintained that such states of consciousness do not
actually arise; for scriptural passages such as, 'He understood
what he said' (Ch. Up. VII, 18, 2), declare them to occur, and
certain means are enjoined to bring them about, such as the hearing
(of the Veda from a teacher) and the recital of the sacred texts.
Nor, again, can such consciousness be objected to on the ground
either of uselessness or of erroneousness, because, firstly, it is
seen to have for its result the cessation of ignorance, and
because, secondly, there is no other kind of knowledge by which it
could be sublated. And that before the knowledge of the unity of
the Self has been reached the whole real-unreal course of ordinary
life, worldly as well as religious, goes on unimpeded, we have
already explained. When, however, final authority having intimated
the unity of the Self, the entire course of the world which was
founded on the previous distinction is sublated, then there is no
longer any opportunity for assuming a Brahman comprising in itself
various elements.</p>
<p>But&mdash;it may be said&mdash;(that would not be a mere
assumption, but) Scripture itself, by quoting the parallel
instances of clay and so on, declares itself in favour of a Brahman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page327" id=
"page327"></a>{327}</span> capable of modification; for we know
from experience that clay and similar things do undergo
modifications.&mdash;This objection&mdash;we reply&mdash;is without
force, because a number of scriptural passages, by denying all
modification of Brahman, teach it to be absolutely changeless
(k&ucirc;<i>t</i>astha). Such passages are, 'This great unborn
Self; undecaying, undying, immortal, fearless, is indeed Brahman'
(B<i>ri</i>. Up. IV, 4, 25); 'That Self is to be described by No,
no' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. III, 9, 26); 'It is neither coarse nor fine'
(B<i>ri</i>. Up. III, 8, 8). For to the one Brahman the two
qualities of being subject to modification and of being free from
it cannot both be ascribed. And if you say, 'Why should they not be
both predicated of Brahman (the former during the time of the
subsistence of the world, the latter during the period of
reabsorption) just as rest and motion may be predicated (of one
body at different times)?' we remark that the qualification,
'absolutely changeless' (k&ucirc;<i>t</i>astha), precludes this.
For the changeless Brahman cannot be the substratum of varying
attributes. And that, on account of the negation of all attributes,
Brahman really is eternal and changeless has already been
demonstrated.&mdash;Moreover, while the cognition of the unity of
Brahman is the instrument of final release, there is nothing to
show that any independent result is connected with the view of
Brahman, by undergoing a modification, passing over into the form
of this world. Scripture expressly declares that the knowledge of
the changeless Brahman being the universal Self leads to a result;
for in the passage which begins, 'That Self is to be described by
No, no,' we read later on, 'O Janaka, you have indeed reached
fearlessness' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. IV, 2, 4). We have then<a id=
"footnotetag285" name="footnotetag285"></a><a href=
"#footnote285"><sup>285</sup></a> to accept the following
conclusion that, in the sections treating of Brahman, an
independent result belongs only to the knowledge of Brahman as
devoid of all attributes and distinctions, and that hence whatever
is stated as having no special fruit of its own&mdash;as, for
instance, the passages about Brahman modifying itself into the form
of this <span class="pagenum"><a name="page328" id=
"page328"></a>{328}</span> world&mdash;is merely to be applied as a
means for the cognition of the absolute Brahman, but does not bring
about an independent result; according to the principle that
whatever has no result of its own, but is mentioned in connexion
with something else which has such a result, is subordinate to the
latter<a id="footnotetag286" name="footnotetag286"></a><a href=
"#footnote286"><sup>286</sup></a>. For to maintain that the result
of the knowledge of Brahman undergoing modifications would be that
the Self (of him who knows that) would undergo corresponding
modifications<a id="footnotetag287" name=
"footnotetag287"></a><a href="#footnote287"><sup>287</sup></a>
would be inappropriate, as the state of filial release (which the
soul obtains through the knowledge of Brahman) is eternally
unchanging.</p>
<p>But, it is objected, he who maintains the nature of Brahman to
be changeless thereby contradicts the fundamental tenet according
to which the Lord is the cause of the world, since the doctrine of
absolute unity leaves no room for the distinction of a Ruler and
something ruled.&mdash;This objection we ward off by remarking that
omniscience, &amp;c. (i.e. those qualities which belong to Brahman
only in so far as it is related to a world) depend on the evolution
of the germinal principles called name and form, whose essence is
Nescience. The fundamental tenet which we maintain (in accordance
with such scriptural passages as, 'From that Self sprang ether,'
&amp;c.; Taitt. Up. II, 1) is that the creation, sustentation, and
reabsorption of the world proceed from an omniscient, omnipotent
Lord, not from a non-intelligent pradh&acirc;na or any other
principle. That tenet we have stated in I, 1, 4, and here we do not
teach anything contrary to it.&mdash;But how, the question may be
asked, can you make this last assertion while all the while you
maintain the absolute unity and non-duality of the
Self?&mdash;Listen how. Belonging to the Self, as it were, of the
omniscient Lord, there are name and form, the figments of
Nescience, not to be defined either <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page329" id="page329"></a>{329}</span> as being (i.e. Brahman),
nor as different from it<a id="footnotetag288" name=
"footnotetag288"></a><a href="#footnote288"><sup>288</sup></a>, the
germs of the entire expanse of the phenomenal world, called in
<i>S</i>rut&icirc; and Sm<i>ri</i>ti the illusion
(m&acirc;y&acirc;), power (<i>s</i>akt&icirc;), or nature
(prak<i>ri</i>ti) of the omniscient Lord. Different from them is
the omniscient Lord himself, as we learn from scriptural passages
such as the following, 'He who is called ether is the revealer of
all forms and names; that within which these forms and names are
contained is Brahman' (Ch. Up. VIII, 14, 1); 'Let me evolve names
and forms' (Ch. Up. VI, 3, 2); 'He, the wise one, who having
divided all forms and given all names, sits speaking (with those
names)' (Taitt. &Acirc;r. III, 12, 7); 'He who makes the one seed
manifold' (<i>S</i>ve. Up. VI, l2).&mdash;Thus the Lord depends (as
Lord) upon the limiting adjuncts of name and form, the products of
Nescience; just as the universal ether depends (as limited ether,
such as the ether of a jar, &amp;c.) upon the limiting adjuncts in
the shape of jars, pots, &amp;c. He (the Lord) stands in the realm
of the phenomenal in the relation of a ruler to the so-called
j&icirc;vas (individual souls) or cognitional Selfs
(vij<i>&ntilde;</i>&acirc;n&acirc;tman), which indeed are one with
his own Self&mdash;just as the portions of ether enclosed in jars
and the like are one with the universal ether&mdash;but are limited
by aggregates of instruments of action (i.e. bodies) produced from
name and form, the presentations of Nescience. Hence the Lord's
being a Lord, his omniscience, his omnipotence, &amp;c. all depend
on the limitation due to the adjuncts whose Self is Nescience;
while in reality none of these qualities belong to the Self whose
true nature is cleared, by right knowledge, from all adjuncts
whatever. Thus Scripture also says, 'Where one sees nothing else,
hears nothing else, understands nothing else, that is the Infinite'
(Ch. Up. VII, 24, 1); 'But when the Self only has become all this,
how should he see another?' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. II, 4, 13.) In this
manner the Ved&acirc;nta-texts declare that for him who has reached
the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page330" id=
"page330"></a>{330}</span> state of truth and reality the whole
apparent world does not exist. The Bhagavadg&icirc;t&acirc; also
('The Lord is not the cause of actions, or of the capacity of
performing actions, or of the connexion of action and fruit; all
that proceeds according to its own nature. The Lord receives no
one's sin or merit. Knowledge is enveloped by Ignorance; hence all
creatures are deluded;' Bha. G&icirc;. V, 14; 15) declares that in
reality the relation of Ruler and ruled does not exist. That, on
the other hand, all those distinctions are valid, as far as the
phenomenal world is concerned, Scripture as well as the
Bhagavadg&icirc;t&acirc; states; compare B<i>ri</i>. Up. IV, 4, 22,
'He is the Lord of all, the king of all things, the protector of
all things; he is a bank and boundary, so that these worlds may not
be confounded;' and Bha. G&icirc;. XVIII, 61, 'The Lord, O Arjuna,
is seated in the region of the heart of all beings, turning round
all beings, (as though) mounted on a machine, by his delusion.' The
S&ucirc;trak&acirc;ra also asserts the non-difference of cause and
effect only with regard to the state of Reality; while he had, in
the preceding S&ucirc;tra, where he looked to the phenomenal world,
compared Brahman to the ocean, &amp;c., that comparison resting on
the assumption of the world of effects not yet having been refuted
(i.e. seen to be unreal).&mdash;The view of Brahman as undergoing
modifications will, moreover, be of use in the devout meditations
on the qualified (sagu<i>n</i>a) Brahman.</p>
<p>15. And because only on the existence (of the cause) (the
effect) is observed.</p>
<p>For the following reason also the effect is non-different from
the cause, because only when the cause exists the effect is
observed to exist, not when it does not exist. For instance, only
when the clay exists the jar is observed to exist, and the cloth
only when the threads exist. That it is not a general rule that
when one thing exists another is also observed to exist, appears,
for instance, from the fact, that a horse which is other
(different) from a cow is not observed to exist only when a cow
exists. Nor is the jar observed to exist only when the potter
exists; for in that case non-difference <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page331" id="page331"></a>{331}</span> does not
exist, although the relation between the two is that of an
operative cause and its effect<a id="footnotetag289" name=
"footnotetag289"></a><a href=
"#footnote289"><sup>289</sup></a>.&mdash;But&mdash;it may be
objected&mdash;even in the case of things other (i.e.
non-identical) we find that the observation of one thing regularly
depends on the existence of another; smoke, for instance, is
observed only when fire exists.&mdash;We reply that this is untrue,
because sometimes smoke is observed even after the fire has been
extinguished; as, for instance, in the case of smoke being kept by
herdsmen in jars.&mdash;Well, then&mdash;the objector will
say&mdash;let us add to smoke a certain qualification enabling us
to say that smoke of such and such a kind<a id="footnotetag290"
name="footnotetag290"></a><a href="#footnote290"><sup>290</sup></a>
does not exist unless fire exists.&mdash;Even thus, we reply, your
objection is not valid, because we declare that the reason for
assuming the non-difference of cause and effect is the fact of the
internal organ (buddhi) being affected (impressed) by cause and
effect jointly<a id="footnotetag291" name=
"footnotetag291"></a><a href="#footnote291"><sup>291</sup></a>. And
that does not take place in the case of fire and smoke.&mdash;Or
else we have to read (in the S&ucirc;tra) 'bh&acirc;v&acirc;t,' and
to translate, 'and on account of the existence or observation.' The
non-difference of cause and effect results not only from Scripture
but also from the existence of perception. For the non-difference
of the two is perceived, for instance, in an aggregate of threads,
where we do not perceive a thing called 'cloth,' in addition to the
threads, but merely threads running lengthways and crossways. So
again, in the threads we perceive finer threads (the aggregate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page332" id=
"page332"></a>{332}</span> of which is identical with the grosser
threads), in them again finer threads, and so on. On the ground of
this our perception we conclude that the finest parts which we can
perceive are ultimately identical with their causes, viz. red,
white, and black (the colours of fire, water, and earth, according
to Ch. Up. VI, 4); those, again, with air, the latter with ether,
and ether with Brahman, which is one and without a second. That all
means of proof lead back to Brahman (as the ultimate cause of the
world; not to pradh&acirc;na, &amp;c.), we have already
explained.</p>
<p>16. And on account of that which is posterior (i.e. the effect)
being that which is.</p>
<p>For the following reason also the effect is to be considered as
non-different (from the cause). That which is posterior in time,
i.e. the effect, is declared by Scripture to have, previous to its
actual beginning, its Being in the cause, by the Self of the cause
merely. For in passages like, 'In the beginning, my dear, this was
that only which is' (Ch. Up. VI, 2, 3); and, 'Verily, in the
beginning this was Self, one only' (Ait. Ar. II, 4, 1, 1), the
effect which is denoted by the word 'this' appears in grammatical
co-ordination with (the word denoting) the cause (from which it
appears that both inhere in the same substratum). A thing, on the
other hand, which does not exist in another thing by the Self of
the latter is not produced from that other thing; for instance, oil
is not produced from sand. Hence as there is non-difference before
the production (of the effect), we understand that the effect even
after having been produced continues to be non-different from the
cause. As the cause, i.e. Brahman, is in all time neither more nor
less than that which is, so the effect also, viz. the world, is in
all time only that which is. But that which is is one only;
therefore the effect is non-different from the cause.</p>
<p>17. If it be said that on account of being denoted as that which
is not (the effect does) not (exist before it is actually
produced); (we reply) not so, (because <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page333" id="page333"></a>{333}</span> the term
'that which is not' denotes) another quality (merely); (as appears)
from the complementary sentence.</p>
<p>But, an objection will be raised, in some places Scripture
speaks of the effect before its production as that which is not;
so, for instance, 'In the beginning this was that only which is
not' (Ch. Up. III, 19, 1); and 'Non-existent<a id="footnotetag292"
name="footnotetag292"></a><a href="#footnote292"><sup>292</sup></a>
indeed this was in the beginning' (Taitt. Up. II, 7). Hence Being
(sattvam) cannot be ascribed to the effect before its
production.</p>
<p>This we deny. For by the Non-existence of the effect previous to
its production is not meant absolute Non-existence, but only a
different quality or state, viz. the state of name and form being
unevolved, which state is different from the state of name and form
being evolved. With reference to the latter state the effect is
called, previous to its production, non-existent although then also
it existed identical with its cause. We conclude this from the
complementary passage, according to the rule that the sense of a
passage whose earlier part is of doubtful meaning is determined by
its complementary part. With reference to the passage. 'In the
beginning this was non-existent only,' we remark that what is there
denoted by the word 'Non-existing' is&mdash;in the complementary
passage, 'That became existent'&mdash;referred to by the word
'that,' and qualified as 'Existent.'</p>
<p>The word 'was' would, moreover, not apply to the (absolutely)
Non-existing, which cannot be conceived as connected with prior or
posterior time.&mdash;Hence with reference to the other passage
also, 'Non-existing indeed,' &amp;c., the complementary part, 'That
made itself its Self,' shows, by the qualification which it
contains, that absolute Non-existence is not meant.&mdash;It
follows from all this that the designation of 'Non-existence'
applied to the effect before its production has reference to a
different state of being merely. And as those things which are
distinguished <span class="pagenum"><a name="page334" id=
"page334"></a>{334}</span> by name and form are in ordinary
language called 'existent,' the term 'non-existent' is figuratively
applied to them to denote the state in which they were previously
to their differentiation.</p>
<p>18. From reasoning and from another Vedic passage.</p>
<p>That the effect exists before its origination and is
non-different from the cause, follows from reasoning as well as
from a further scriptural passage.</p>
<p>We at first set forth the argumentation.&mdash;Ordinary
experience teaches us that those who wish to produce certain
effects, such as curds, or earthen jars, or golden ornaments,
employ for their purpose certain determined causal substances such
as milk, clay, and gold; those who wish to produce sour milk do not
employ clay, nor do those who intend to make jars employ milk and
so on. But, according to that doctrine which teaches that the
effect is non-existent (before its actual production), all this
should be possible. For if before their actual origination all
effects are equally non-existent in any causal substance, why then
should curds be produced from milk only and not from clay also, and
jars from clay only and not from milk as well?&mdash;Let us then
maintain, the asatk&acirc;ryav&acirc;din rejoins, that there is
indeed an equal non-existence of any effect in any cause, but that
at the same time each causal substance has a certain capacity
reaching beyond itself (ati<i>s</i>aya) for some particular effect
only and not for other effects; that, for instance, milk only, and
not clay, has a certain capacity for curds; and clay only, and not
milk, an analogous capacity for jars.&mdash;What, we ask in return,
do you understand by that 'ati<i>s</i>aya?' If you understand by it
the antecedent condition of the effect (before its actual
origination), you abandon your doctrine that the effect does not
exist in the cause, and prove our doctrine according to which it
does so exist. If, on the other hand, you understand by the
ati<i>s</i>aya a certain power of the cause assumed to the end of
accounting for the fact that only one determined effect springs
from the cause, you must admit that the power can <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page335" id="page335"></a>{335}</span> determine
the particular effect only if it neither is other (than cause and
effect) nor non-existent; for if it were either, it would not be
different from anything else which is either non-existent or other
than cause and effect, (and how then should it alone be able to
produce the particular effect?) Hence it follows that that power is
identical with the Self of the cause, and that the effect is
identical with the Self of that power.&mdash;Moreover, as the ideas
of cause and effect on the one hand and of substance and qualities
on the other hand are not separate ones, as, for instance, the
ideas of a horse and a buffalo, it follows that the identity of the
cause and the effect as well as of the substance and its qualities
has to be admitted. Let it then be assumed, the opponent rejoins,
that the cause and the effect, although really different, are not
apprehended as such, because they are connected by the so-called
samav&acirc;ya connexion<a id="footnotetag293" name=
"footnotetag293"></a><a href=
"#footnote293"><sup>293</sup></a>.&mdash;If, we reply, you assume
the samav&acirc;ya connexion between cause and effect, you have
either to admit that the samav&acirc;ya itself is joined by a
certain connexion to the two terms which are connected by
samav&acirc;ya, and then that connexion will again require a new
connexion (joining it to the two terms which it binds together),
and you will thus be compelled to postulate an infinite series of
connexions; or else you will have to maintain that the
samav&acirc;ya is not joined by any connexion to the terms which it
binds together, and from that will result the dissolution of the
bond which connects the two terms of the samav&acirc;ya
relation<a id="footnotetag294" name="footnotetag294"></a><a href=
"#footnote294"><sup>294</sup></a>.&mdash;Well then, the opponent
rejoins, let us assume that the samav&acirc;ya connexion as itself
being a connexion may be connected with the terms which it joins
without the help of any further connexion.&mdash;Then, we reply,
conjunction (sa<i>m</i>yoga) also must be connected with the two
terms which it joins without the help of the samav&acirc;ya
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page336" id=
"page336"></a>{336}</span> connexion; for conjunction also is a
kind of connexion<a id="footnotetag295" name=
"footnotetag295"></a><a href=
"#footnote295"><sup>295</sup></a>.&mdash;Moreover, as substances,
qualities, and so on are apprehended as standing in the relation of
identity, the assumption of the samav&acirc;ya relation has really
no purport.</p>
<p>In what manner again do you&mdash;who maintain that the cause
and the effect are joined by the samav&acirc;ya
relation&mdash;assume a substance consisting of parts which is an
effect to abide in its causes, i.e. in the material parts of which
it consists? Does it abide in all the parts taken together or in
each particular part?&mdash;If you say that it abides in all parts
together, it follows that the whole as such cannot be perceived, as
it is impossible that all the parts should be in contact with the
organs of perception. (And let it not be objected that the whole
may be apprehended through some of the parts only), for manyness
which abides in all its substrates together (i.e. in all the many
things), is not apprehended so long as only some of those
substrates are apprehended.&mdash;Let it then be assumed that the
whole abides in all the parts by the mediation of intervening
aggregates of parts<a id="footnotetag296" name=
"footnotetag296"></a><a href=
"#footnote296"><sup>296</sup></a>.&mdash;In that case, we reply, we
should have to assume other parts in addition to the primary
originative parts of the whole, in order that by means of those
other parts the whole could abide in the primary parts in the
manner indicated by you. For we see (that one thing which abides in
another abides there by means of parts different from those of that
other thing), that the sword, for instance, pervades the sheath by
means of parts different from the parts of the sheath. But an
assumption of that kind would lead us into a regressus in
infinitum, because in order to explain how the whole abides in
certain <span class="pagenum"><a name="page337" id=
"page337"></a>{337}</span> given parts we should always have to
assume further parts<a id="footnotetag297" name=
"footnotetag297"></a><a href=
"#footnote297"><sup>297</sup></a>.&mdash;Well, then, let us
maintain the second alternative, viz. that the whole abides in each
particular part.&mdash;That also cannot be admitted; for if the
whole is present in one part it cannot be present in other parts
also; not any more than Devadatta can be present in <i>S</i>rughna
and in P&acirc;<i>t</i>aliputra on one and the same day. If the
whole were present in more than one part, several wholes would
result, comparable to Devadatta and Yaj<i>&ntilde;</i>adatta, who,
as being two different persons, may live one of them at
<i>S</i>rughna and the other at P&acirc;<i>t</i>aliputra.&mdash;If
the opponent should rejoin that the whole may be fully present in
each part, just as the generic character of the cow is fully
present in each individual cow; we point out that the generic
attributes of the cow are visibly perceived in each individual cow,
but that the whole is not thus perceived in each particular part.
If the whole were fully present in each part, the consequence would
be that the whole would produce its effects indifferently with any
of its parts; a cow, for instance, would give milk from her horns
or her tail. But such things are not seen to take place.</p>
<p>We proceed to consider some further arguments opposed to the
doctrine that the effect does not exist in the cause.&mdash;That
doctrine involves the conclusion that the actual origination of an
effect is without an agent and thus devoid of substantial being.
For origination is an action, and as such requires an agent<a id=
"footnotetag298" name="footnotetag298"></a><a href=
"#footnote298"><sup>298</sup></a>, just as the action of walking
does. To speak of an action without an agent would be a
contradiction. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page338" id=
"page338"></a>{338}</span> But if you deny the pre-existence of the
effect in the cause, it would have to be assumed that whenever the
origination of a jar, for instance, is spoken of the agent is not
the jar (which before its origination did not exist) but something
else, and again that when the origination of the two halves of the
jar is spoken of the agent is not the two halves but something
else. From this it would follow that the sentence, 'the jar is
originated' means as much as 'the potter and the other (operative)
causes are originated<a id="footnotetag299" name=
"footnotetag299"></a><a href="#footnote299"><sup>299</sup></a>.'
But as a matter of fact the former sentence is never understood to
mean the latter; and it is, moreover, known that at the time when
the jar originates, the potter, &amp;c. are already in
existence.&mdash;Let us then say, the opponent resumes, that
origination is the connexion of the effect with the existence of
its cause and its obtaining existence as a Self.&mdash;How, we ask
in reply, can something which has not yet obtained existence enter
into connexion with something else? A connexion is possible of two
existing things only, not of one existing and one non-existing
thing or of two non-existing things. To something non-existing
which on that account is indefinable, it is moreover not possible
to assign a limit as the opponent does when maintaining that the
effect is non-existing before its origination; for experience
teaches us that existing things only such as fields and houses have
limits, but not non-existing things. If somebody should use, for
instance, a phrase such as the following one, 'The son of a barren
woman was king previously to the coronation of
P&ucirc;r<i>n</i>avarman' the declaration of a limit in time
implied in that phrase does not in reality determine that the son
of the barren woman, i.e. a mere non-entity, either was or is or
will be king. If the son of a barren woman could become an existing
thing subsequently to the activity of some causal <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page339" id="page339"></a>{339}</span> agent, in
that case it would be possible also that the non-existing effect
should be something existing, subsequently to the activity of some
causal agent. But we know that the one thing can take place no more
than the other thing; the non-existing effect and the son of the
barren woman are both equally non-entities and can never
be.&mdash;But, the asatk&acirc;ryav&acirc;din here objects, from
your doctrine there follows the result that the activity of causal
agents is altogether purposeless. For if the effect were lying
already fully accomplished in the cause and were non-different from
it, nobody would endeavour to bring it about, no more than anybody
endeavours to bring about the cause which is already fully
accomplished previously to all endeavour. But as a matter of fact
causal agents do endeavour to bring about effects, and it is in
order not to have to condemn their efforts as altogether useless
that we assume the non-existence of the effect previously to its
origination.&mdash;Your objection is refuted, we reply, by the
consideration that the endeavour of the causal agent may be looked
upon as having a purpose in so far as it arranges the causal
substance in the form of the effect. That, however, even the form
of the effect (is not something previously non-existing, but)
belongs to the Self of the cause already because what is devoid of
Selfhood cannot be begun at all, we have already shown
above.&mdash;Nor does a substance become another substance merely
by appearing under a different aspect. Devadatta may at one time be
seen with his arms and legs closely drawn up to his body, and
another time with his arms and legs stretched out, and yet he
remains the same substantial being, for he is recognised as such.
Thus the persons also by whom we are surrounded, such as fathers,
mothers, brothers, &amp;c., remain the same, although we see them
in continually changing states and attitudes; for they are always
recognised as fathers, mothers, brothers, and so on. If our
opponent objects to this last illustrative example on the ground
that fathers, mothers, and so on remain the same substantial
beings, because the different states in which they appear are not
separated from each other by birth or death, while the effect, for
instance a jar, appears only after <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page340" id="page340"></a>{340}</span> the cause, for instance the
clay, has undergone destruction as it were (so that the effect may
be looked upon as something altogether different from the cause);
we rebut this objection by remarking that causal substances also
such as milk, for instance, are perceived to exist even after they
have entered into the condition of effects such as curds and the
like (so that we have no right to say that the cause undergoes
destruction). And even in those cases where the continued existence
of the cause is not perceived, as, for instance, in the case of
seeds of the fig-tree from which there spring sprouts and trees,
the term 'birth' (when applied to the sprout) only means that the
causal substance, viz. the seed, becomes visible by becoming a
sprout through the continual accretion of similar particles of
matter; and the term 'death' only means that, through the secession
of those particles, the cause again passes beyond the sphere of
visibility. Nor can it be said that from such separation by birth
and death as described just now it follows that the non-existing
becomes existing, and the existing non-existing; for if that were
so, it would also follow that the unborn child in the mother's womb
and the new-born babe stretched out on the bed are altogether
different beings.</p>
<p>It would further follow that a man is not the same person in
childhood, manhood, and old age, and that terms such as father and
the like are illegitimately used.&mdash;The preceding arguments may
also be used to refute the (Bauddha doctrine) of all existence
being momentary only<a id="footnotetag300" name=
"footnotetag300"></a><a href="#footnote300"><sup>300</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The doctrine that the effect is non-existent previously to its
actual origination, moreover, leads to the conclusion that the
activity of the causal agent has no object; for what does not exist
cannot possibly be an object; not any more than the ether can be
cleft by swords and other weapons for striking or cutting. The
object can certainly not be the inherent cause; for that would lead
to the erroneous conclusion that from the activity of the causal
agent, which has for its object the inherent cause, there results
something else <span class="pagenum"><a name="page341" id=
"page341"></a>{341}</span> (viz. the effect). And if (in order to
preclude this erroneous conclusion) the opponent should say that
the effect is (not something different from the cause, but) a
certain relative power (ati<i>s</i>aya) of the inherent cause; he
thereby would simply concede our doctrine, according to which the
effect exists in the cause already.</p>
<p>We maintain, therefore, as our final conclusion, that milk and
other substances are called effects when they are in the state of
curds and so on, and that it is impossible, even within hundreds of
years, ever to bring about an effect which is different from its
cause. The fundamental cause of all appears in the form of this and
that effect, up to the last effect of all, just as an actor appears
in various robes and costumes, and thereby becomes the basis for
all the current notions and terms concerning the phenomenal
world.</p>
<p>The conclusion here established, on the ground of reasoning,
viz. that the effect exists already before its origination, and is
non-different from its cause, results also from a different
scriptural passage. As under the preceding S&ucirc;tra a Vedic
passage was instanced which speaks of the non-existing, the
different passage referred to in the present S&ucirc;tra is the one
(Ch. Up. VI, 2, 1) which refers to that which is. That passage
begins, 'Being only was this in the beginning, one without a
second,' refers, thereupon, to the doctrine of the Non-existent
being the cause of the world ('Others say, Non-being was this in
the beginning'), raises an objection against that doctrine ('How
could that which is be born of that which is not?'), and, finally,
reaffirms the view first set forth, 'Only Being was this in the
beginning.' The circumstance that in this passage the effect, which
is denoted by the word 'this,' is by Scripture, with reference to
the time previous to its origination, coordinated with the cause
denoted by the term 'Being,' proves that the effect exists
in&mdash;and is non-different from&mdash;the cause. If it were
before its origination non-existing and after it inhered in its
cause by samav&acirc;ya, it would be something different from the
cause, and that would virtually imply an abandonment of the promise
made in the passage, 'That instruction by which we hear what is not
heard,' &amp;c. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page342" id=
"page342"></a>{342}</span> (VI, 1, 3). The latter assertion is
ratified, on the other hand, through the comprehension that the
effect exists in&mdash;and is not different from-the cause.</p>
<p>19. And like a piece of cloth.</p>
<p>As of a folded piece of cloth we do not know clearly whether it
is a piece of cloth or some other thing, while on its being
unfolded it becomes manifest that the folded thing was a piece of
cloth; and as, so long as it is folded, we perhaps know that it is
a piece of cloth but not of what definite length and width it is,
while on its being unfolded we know these particulars, and at the
same time that the cloth is not different from the folded object;
in the same way an effect, such as a piece of cloth, is
non-manifest as long as it exists in its causes, i.e. the threads,
&amp;c. merely, while it becomes manifest and is clearly
apprehended in consequence of the operations of shuttle, loom,
weaver, and so on.&mdash;Applying this instance of the piece of
cloth, first folded and then unfolded, to the general case of cause
and effect, we conclude that the latter is non-different from the
former.</p>
<p>20. And as in the case of the different vital airs.</p>
<p>It is a matter of observation that when the operations of the
different kinds of vital air&mdash;such as pr&acirc;<i>n</i>a the
ascending vital air, ap&acirc;na the descending vital air,
&amp;c.&mdash;are suspended, in consequence of the breath being
held so that they exist in their causes merely, the only effect
which continues to be accomplished is life, while all other
effects, such as the bending and stretching of the limbs and so on,
are stopped. When, thereupon, the vital airs again begin to act,
those other effects also are brought about, in addition to mere
life.&mdash;Nor must the vital airs, on account of their being
divided into classes, be considered as something else than vital
air; for wind (air) constitutes their common character. Thus (i.e.
in the manner illustrated by the instance of the vital airs) the
non-difference of the effect from the cause is to be
conceived.&mdash;As, therefore, the whole world is an effect of
Brahman and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page343" id=
"page343"></a>{343}</span> non-different from it, the promise held
out in the scriptural passage that 'What is not heard is heard,
what is not perceived is perceived, what is not known is known'
(Ch. Up. VI, 1, 3) is fulfilled<a id="footnotetag301" name=
"footnotetag301"></a><a href="#footnote301"><sup>301</sup></a>.</p>
<p>21. On account of the other (i.e. the individual soul) being
designated (as non-different from Brahman) there would attach (to
Brahman) various faults, as, for instance, not doing what is
beneficial.</p>
<p>Another objection is raised against the doctrine of an
intelligent cause of the world.&mdash;If that doctrine is accepted,
certain faults, as, for instance, doing what is not beneficial,
will attach (to the intelligent cause, i.e. Brahman), 'on account
of the other being designated.' For Scripture declares the other,
i.e. the embodied soul, to be one with Brahman, as is shown by the
passage, 'That is the Self; that art thou, O <i>S</i>vetaketu!'
(Ch. Up. VI, 8, 7.)&mdash;Or else (if we interpret 'the other' of
the S&ucirc;tra in a different way) Scripture declares the other,
i.e. Brahman, to be the Self of the embodied soul. For the passage,
'Having created that he entered into it,' declares the creator,
i.e. the unmodified Brahman, to constitute the Self of the embodied
soul, in consequence of his entering into his products. The
following passage also, 'Entering (into them) with this living Self
I will evolve names and forms' (Ch. Up. VI, 3, 2), in which the
highest divinity designates the living (soul) by the word 'Self,'
shows that the embodied Self is not different from Brahman.
Therefore the creative power of Brahman belongs to the embodied
Self also, and the latter, being thus an independent agent, might
be expected to produce only what is beneficial to itself, and not
things of a contrary nature, such as birth, death, old age,
disease, and whatever may be the other meshes of the net of
suffering. For we know that no free person will build a prison for
himself, and take up his abode in it. Nor would a being, itself
absolutely stainless, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page344" id=
"page344"></a>{344}</span> look on this altogether unclean body as
forming part of its Self. It would, moreover, free itself,
according to its liking, of the consequences of those of its former
actions which result in pain, and would enjoy the consequences of
those actions only which are rewarded by pleasure. Further, it
would remember that it had created this manifold world; for every
person who has produced some clearly appearing effect remembers
that he has been the cause of it. And as the magician easily
retracts, whenever he likes, the magical illusion which he had
emitted, so the embodied soul also would be able to reabsorb this
world into itself. The fact is, however, that the embodied soul
cannot reabsorb its own body even. As we therefore see that 'what
would be beneficial is not done,' the hypothesis of the world
having proceeded from an intelligent cause is unacceptable.</p>
<p>22. But the separate (Brahman, i.e. the Brahman separate from
the individual souls) (is the creator); (the existence of which
separate Brahman we learn) from the declaration of difference.</p>
<p>The word 'but' discards the p&ucirc;rvapaksha.&mdash;We rather
declare that that omniscient, omnipotent Brahman, whose essence is
eternal pure cognition and freedom, and which is additional to,
i.e. different from the embodied Self, is the creative principle of
the world. The faults specified above, such as doing what is not
beneficial, and the like, do not attach to that Brahman; for as
eternal freedom is its characteristic nature, there is nothing
either beneficial to be done by it or non-beneficial to be avoided
by it. Nor is there any impediment to its knowledge and power; for
it is omniscient and omnipotent. The embodied Self, on the other
hand, is of a different nature, and to it the mentioned faults
adhere. But then we do not declare it to be the creator of the
world, on account of 'the declaration of difference.' For
scriptural passages (such as, 'Verily, the Self is to be seen, to
be heard, to be perceived, to be marked,' B<i>ri</i>. Up. II, 4, 5;
'The Self we must search out, we must try to understand,' Ch. Up.
VIII, 7, 1; 'Then he becomes <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page345" id="page345"></a>{345}</span> united with the True,' Ch.
Up. VI, 8, 1; 'This embodied Self mounted by the intelligent Self,'
B<i>ri</i>. Up. IV, 3, 35) declare differences founded on the
relations of agent, object, and so on, and thereby show Brahman to
be different from the individual soul.&mdash;And if it be objected
that there are other passages declaratory of non-difference (for
instance, 'That art thou'), and that difference and non-difference
cannot co-exist because contradictory, we reply that the
possibility of the co-existence of the two is shown by the parallel
instance of the universal ether and the ether limited by a
jar.&mdash;Moreover, as soon as, in consequence of the declaration
of non-difference contained in such passages as 'that art thou,'
the consciousness of non-difference arises in us, the
transmigratory state of the individual soul and the creative
quality of Brahman vanish at once, the whole phenomenon of
plurality, which springs from wrong knowledge, being sublated by
perfect knowledge, and what becomes then of the creation and the
faults of not doing what is beneficial, and the like? For that this
entire apparent world, in which good and evil actions are done,
&amp;c., is a mere illusion, owing to the non-discrimination of
(the Self's) limiting adjuncts, viz. a body, and so on, which
spring from name and form the presentations of Nescience, and does
in reality not exist at all, we have explained more than once. The
illusion is analogous to the mistaken notion we entertain as to the
dying, being born, being hurt, &amp;c. of ourselves (our Selfs;
while in reality the body only dies, is born, &amp;c.). And with
regard to the state in which the appearance of plurality is not yet
sublated, it follows from passages declaratory of such difference
(as, for instance, 'That we must search for,' &amp;c.) that Brahman
is superior to the individual soul; whereby the possibility of
faults adhering to it is excluded.</p>
<p>23. And because the case is analogous to that of stones, &amp;c.
(the objections raised) cannot be established.</p>
<p>As among minerals, which are all mere modifications of earth,
nevertheless great variety is observed, some being <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page346" id="page346"></a>{346}</span> precious
gems, such as diamonds, lapis lazuli, &amp;c., others, such as
crystals and the like, being of medium value, and others again
stones only fit to be flung at dogs or crows; and as from seeds
which are placed in one and the same ground various plants are seen
to spring, such as sandalwood and cucumbers, which show the
greatest difference in their leaves, blossoms, fruits, fragrancy,
juice, &amp;c.; and as one and the same food produces various
effects, such as blood and hair; so the one Brahman also may
contain in itself the distinction of the individual Selfs and the
highest Self, and may produce various effects. Hence the objections
imagined by others (against the doctrine of Brahman being the cause
of the world) cannot be maintained.&mdash;Further<a id=
"footnotetag302" name="footnotetag302"></a><a href=
"#footnote302"><sup>302</sup></a> arguments are furnished by the
fact of all effect having, as Scripture declares, their origin in
speech only, and by the analogous instance of the variety of dream
phantoms (while the dreaming person remains one).</p>
<p>24. If you object on the ground of the observation of the
employment (of instruments); (we say), No; because as milk
(transforms itself, so Brahman does).</p>
<p>Your assertion that the intelligent Brahman alone, without a
second, is the cause of the world cannot be maintained, on account
of the observation of employment (of instruments). For in ordinary
life we see that potters, weavers, and other handicraftsmen produce
jars, cloth, and the like, after having put themselves in
possession of the means thereto by providing themselves with
various implements, such as clay, staffs, wheels, string, &amp;c.;
Brahman, on the other hand, you conceive to be without any help;
how then can it act as a creator without providing itself with
instruments to work with? We therefore maintain that Brahman is not
the cause of the world.</p>
<p>This objection is not valid, because causation is possible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page347" id=
"page347"></a>{347}</span> in consequence of a peculiar
constitution of the causal substance, as in the case of milk. Just
as milk and water turn into curds and ice respectively, without any
extraneous means, so it is in the case of Brahman also. And if you
object to this analogy for the reason that milk, in order to turn
into curds, does require an extraneous agent, viz. heat, we reply
that milk by itself also undergoes a certain amount of definite
change, and that its turning is merely accelerated by heat. If milk
did not possess that capability of itself, heat could not compel it
to turn; for we see that air or ether, for instance, is not
compelled by the action of heat to turn into sour milk. By the
co-operation of auxiliary means the milk's capability of turning
into sour milk is merely completed. The absolutely complete power
of Brahman, on the other hand, does not require to be supplemented
by any extraneous help. Thus Scripture also declares, 'There is no
effect and no instrument known of him, no one is seen like unto him
or better; his high power is revealed as manifold, as inherent,
acting as force and knowledge' (<i>S</i>ve. Up. VI, 8). Therefore
Brahman, although one only, is, owing to its manifold powers, able
to transform itself into manifold effects; just as milk is.</p>
<p>25. And (the case of Brahman is) like that of gods and other
beings in ordinary experience.</p>
<p>Well, let it be admitted that milk and other non-intelligent
things have the power of turning themselves into sour milk, &amp;c.
without any extraneous means, since it is thus observed. But we
observe, on the other hand, that intelligent agents, as, for
instance, potters, proceed to their several work only after having
provided themselves with a complete set of instruments. How then
can it be supposed that Brahman, which is likewise of an
intelligent nature, should proceed without any auxiliary?</p>
<p>We reply, 'Like gods and others.' As gods, fathers,
<i>ri</i>shis, and other beings of great power, who are all of
intelligent nature, are seen to create many and various objects,
such as palaces, chariots, &amp;c., without availing themselves of
any <span class="pagenum"><a name="page348" id=
"page348"></a>{348}</span> extraneous means, by their mere
intention, which is effective in consequence of those beings'
peculiar power&mdash;a fact vouchsafed by mantras,
arthav&acirc;das, itih&acirc;sas, and
pur&acirc;<i>n</i>as;&mdash;and as the spider emits out of itself
the threads of its web; and as the female crane conceives without a
male; and as the lotus wanders from one pond to another without any
means of conveyance; so the intelligent Brahman also may be assumed
to create the world by itself without extraneous means.</p>
<p>Perhaps our opponent will argue against all this in the
following style.&mdash;The gods and other beings, whom you have
quoted as parallel instances, are really of a nature different from
that of Brahman. For the material causes operative in the
production of palaces and other material things are the bodies of
the gods, and not their intelligent Selfs. And the web of the
spider is produced from its saliva which, owing to the spider's
devouring small insects, acquires a certain degree of consistency.
And the female crane conceives from hearing the sound of thunder.
And the lotus flower indeed derives from its indwelling intelligent
principle the impulse of movement, but is not able actually to move
in so far as it is a merely intelligent being<a id="footnotetag303"
name="footnotetag303"></a><a href=
"#footnote303"><sup>303</sup></a>; it rather wanders from pond to
pond by means of its non-intelligent body, just as the creeper
climbs up the tree.&mdash;Hence all these illustrative examples
cannot be applied to the case of Brahman.</p>
<p>To this we reply, that we meant to show merely that the case of
Brahman is different from that of potters and similar agents. For
while potters, &amp;c., on the one side, and gods, &amp;c., on the
other side, possess the common attribute of intelligence, potters
require for their work extraneous means (i.e. means lying outside
their bodies) and gods do not. Hence Brahman also, although
intelligent, is assumed to require no extraneous means. So much
only we wanted to show by the parallel instance of the gods,
&amp;c. Our intention is to point out that a peculiarly conditioned
capability which <span class="pagenum"><a name="page349" id=
"page349"></a>{349}</span> is observed in some one case (as in that
of the potter) is not necessarily to be assumed in all other cases
also.</p>
<p>26. Either the consequence of the entire (Brahman undergoing
change) has to be accepted, or else a violation of the texts
declaring Brahman to be without parts.</p>
<p>Hitherto we have established so much that Brahman, intelligent,
one, without a second, modifying itself without the employment of
any extraneous means, is the cause of the world.&mdash;Now, another
objection is raised for the purpose of throwing additional light on
the point under discussion.&mdash;The consequence of the
Ved&acirc;nta doctrine, it is said, will be that we must assume the
entire Brahman to undergo the change into its effects, because it
is not composed of parts. If Brahman, like earth and other matter,
consisted of parts, we might assume that a part of it undergoes the
change, while the other part remains as it is. But Scripture
distinctly declares Brahman to be devoid of parts. Compare, 'He who
is without parts, without actions, tranquil, without fault, without
taint' (<i>Sv</i>e. Up. VI, 19); 'That heavenly person is without
body, he is both without and within, not produced' (Mu. Up. II, 1,
2); 'That great Being is endless, unlimited, consisting of nothing
but knowledge' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. II, 4, 12); 'He is to be described
by No, no' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. III, 9, 2,6); 'It is neither coarse nor
fine' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. III, 8, 8); all which passages deny the
existence of any distinctions in Brahman.&mdash;As, therefore, a
partial modification is impossible, a modification of the entire
Brahman has to be assumed. But that involves a cutting off of
Brahman from its very basis.&mdash;Another consequence of the
Ved&acirc;ntic view is that the texts exhorting us to strive 'to
see' Brahman become purposeless; for the effects of Brahman may be
seen without any endeavour, and apart from them no Brahman
exists.&mdash;And, finally, the texts declaring Brahman to be
unborn are contradicted thereby.&mdash;If, on the other
hand&mdash;in order to escape from these difficulties&mdash;we
assume Brahman to consist of parts, we thereby do violence to those
texts which declare Brahman not to be made up of parts.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page350" id=
"page350"></a>{350}</span> Moreover, if Brahman is made up of
parts, it follows that it is non-eternal.&mdash;Hence the
Ved&acirc;ntic point of view cannot be maintained in any way.</p>
<p>27. But (this is not so), on account of scriptural passages, and
on account of (Brahman) resting on Scripture (only).</p>
<p>The word 'but' discards the objection.&mdash;We deny this and
maintain that our view is not open to any objections.&mdash;That
the entire Brahman undergoes change, by no means follows from our
doctrine, 'on account of sacred texts.' For in the same way as
Scripture speaks of the origin of the world from Brahman, it also
speaks of Brahman subsisting apart from its effects. This appears
from the passages indicating the difference of cause and effect
'(That divinity thought) let me enter into these three divinities
with this living Self and evolve names and forms;' and, 'Such is
the greatness of it, greater than it is the Person; one foot of him
are all things, three feet are what is immortal in heaven' (Ch. Up.
III, 12, 6); further, from the passages declaring the unmodified
Brahman to have its abode in the heart, and from those teaching
that (in dreamless sleep) the individual soul is united with the
True. For if the entire Brahman had passed into its effects, the
limitation (of the soul's union with Brahman) to the state of
dreamless sleep which is declared in the passage, 'then it is
united with the True, my dear,' would be out of place; since the
individual soul is always united with the effects of Brahman, and
since an unmodified Brahman does not exist (on that hypothesis).
Moreover, the possibility of Brahman becoming the object of
perception by means of the senses is denied while its effects may
thus be perceived. For these reasons the existence of an unmodified
Brahman has to be admitted.&mdash;Nor do we violate those texts
which declare Brahman to be without parts; we rather admit Brahman
to be without parts just because Scripture reveals it. For Brahman
which rests exclusively on the holy texts, and regarding which the
holy texts alone are authoritative&mdash;not <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page351" id="page351"></a>{351}</span> the
senses, and so on&mdash;must be accepted such as the texts proclaim
it to be. Now those texts declare, on the one hand, that not the
entire Brahman passes over into its effects, and, on the other
hand, that Brahman is without parts. Even certain ordinary things
such as gems, spells, herbs, and the like possess powers which,
owing to difference of time, place, occasion, and so on, produce
various opposite effects, and nobody unaided by instruction is able
to find out by mere reflection the number of these powers, their
favouring conditions, their objects, their purposes, &amp;c.; how
much more impossible is it to conceive without the aid of Scripture
the true nature of Brahman with its powers unfathomable by thought!
As the Pur&acirc;<i>n</i>a says: 'Do not apply reasoning to what is
unthinkable! The mark of the unthinkable is that it is above all
material causes<a id="footnotetag304" name=
"footnotetag304"></a><a href="#footnote304"><sup>304</sup></a>.'
Therefore the cognition of what is supersensuous is based on the
holy texts only.</p>
<p>But&mdash;our opponent will say&mdash;even the holy texts cannot
make us understand what is contradictory. Brahman, you say, which
is without parts undergoes a change, but not the entire Brahman. If
Brahman is without parts, it does either not change at all or it
changes in its entirety. If, on the other hand, it be said that it
changes partly and persists partly, a break is effected in its
nature, and from that it follows that it consists of parts. It is
true that in matters connected with action (as, for instance, in
the case of the two Vedic injunctions 'at the atir&acirc;tra he is
to take the sho<i>d</i>a<i>s</i>in-cup,' and 'at the atir&acirc;tra
he is not to take the sho<i>d</i>a<i>s</i>in-cup') any
contradiction which may present itself to the understanding is
removed by the optional adoption of one of the two alternatives
presented as action is dependent on man; but in the case under
discussion the adoption of one of the alternatives does not remove
the contradiction because an existent thing (like Brahman) does not
(like an action which is to be accomplished) depend on man. We are
therefore met here by a real difficulty.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page352" id=
"page352"></a>{352}</span>
<p>No, we reply, the difficulty is merely an apparent one; as we
maintain that the (alleged) break in Brahman's nature is a mere
figment of Nescience. By a break of that nature a thing is not
really broken up into parts, not any more than the moon is really
multiplied by appearing double to a person of defective vision. By
that element of plurality which is the fiction of Nescience, which
is characterised by name and form, which is evolved as well as
non-evolved, which is not to be defined either as the Existing or
the Non-existing, Brahman becomes the basis of this entire apparent
world with its changes, and so on, while in its true and real
nature it at the same time remains unchanged, lifted above the
phenomenal universe. And as the distinction of names and forms, the
fiction of Nescience, originates entirely from speech only, it does
not militate against the fact of Brahman being without
parts.&mdash;Nor have the scriptural passages which speak of
Brahman as undergoing change the purpose of teaching the fact of
change; for such instruction would have no fruit. They rather aim
at imparting instruction about Brahman's Self as raised above this
apparent world; that being an instruction which we know to have a
result of its own. For in the scriptural passage beginning 'He can
only be described by No, no' (which passage conveys instruction
about the absolute Brahman) a result is stated at the end, in the
words 'O Janaka, you have indeed reached fearlessness' (B<i>ri</i>.
Up. IV, 2, 4).&mdash;Hence our view does not involve any real
difficulties.</p>
<p>28. For thus it is in the (individual) Self also, and various
(creations exist in gods<a id="footnotetag305" name=
"footnotetag305"></a><a href="#footnote305"><sup>305</sup></a>,
&amp;c.).</p>
<p>Nor is there any reason to find fault with the doctrine that
there can be a manifold creation in the one Self, without
destroying its character. For Scripture teaches us that there
exists a multiform creation in the one Self <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page353" id="page353"></a>{353}</span> of a
dreaming person, 'There are no chariots in that state, no horses,
no roads, but he himself creates chariots, horses, and roads'
(B<i>ri</i>. Up. IV, 3, 10). In ordinary life too multiform
creations, elephants, horses, and the like are seen to exist in
gods, &amp;c., and magicians without interfering with the unity of
their being. Thus a multiform creation may exist in Brahman also,
one as it is, without divesting it of its character of unity.</p>
<p>29. And because the objection (raised against our view) lies
against his (the opponent's) view likewise.</p>
<p>Those also who maintain that the world has sprung from the
pradh&acirc;na implicitly teach that something not made up of
parts, unlimited, devoid of sound and other qualities&mdash;viz.
the pradh&acirc;na&mdash;is the cause of an effect&mdash;viz. the
world&mdash;which is made up of parts, is limited and is
characterised by the named qualities. Hence it follows from that
doctrine also either that the pradh&acirc;na as not consisting of
parts has to undergo a change in its entirety, or else that the
view of its not consisting of parts has to be
abandoned.&mdash;But&mdash;it might be pleaded in favour of the
S&acirc;@nkhyas&mdash;they do not maintain their pradh&acirc;na to
be without parts; for they define it as the state of equilibrium of
the three gu<i>n</i>as, Goodness, Passion, and Darkness, so that
the pradh&acirc;na forms a whole containing the three gu<i>n</i>as
as its parts.&mdash;We reply that such a partiteness as is here
proposed does not remove the objection in hand because still each
of the three qualities is declared to be in itself without
parts<a id="footnotetag306" name="footnotetag306"></a><a href=
"#footnote306"><sup>306</sup></a>. And each gu<i>n</i>a by itself
assisted merely by the two other gu<i>n</i>as constitutes the
material cause of that part of the world which resembles it in its
nature<a id="footnotetag307" name="footnotetag307"></a><a href=
"#footnote307"><sup>307</sup></a>.&mdash;So that the objection lies
against the S&acirc;@nkhya <span class="pagenum"><a name="page354"
id="page354"></a>{354}</span> view likewise.&mdash;Well, then, as
the reasoning (on which the doctrine of the impartiteness of the
pradh&acirc;na rests) is not absolutely safe, let us assume that
the pradh&acirc;na consists of parts.&mdash;If you do that, we
reply, it follows that the pradh&acirc;na cannot be eternal, and so
on.&mdash;Let it then be said that the various powers of the
pradh&acirc;na to which the variety of its effects is pointing are
its parts.&mdash;Well, we reply, those various powers are admitted
by us also who see the cause of the world in Brahman.</p>
<p>The same objections lie against the doctrine of the world having
originated from atoms. For on that doctrine one atom when combining
with another must, as it is not made up of parts, enter into the
combination with its whole extent, and as thus no increase of bulk
takes place we do not get beyond the first atom.<a id=
"footnotetag308" name="footnotetag308"></a><a href=
"#footnote308"><sup>308</sup></a> If, on the other hand, you
maintain that the atom enters into the combination with a part
only, you offend against the assumption of the atoms having no
parts.</p>
<p>As therefore all views are equally obnoxious to the objections
raised, the latter cannot be urged against any one view in
particular, and the advocate of Brahman has consequently cleared
his doctrine.</p>
<p>30. And (the highest divinity is) endowed with all (powers)
because that is seen (from Scripture).</p>
<p>We have stated that this multiform world of effects is possible
to Brahman, because, although one only, it is endowed with various
powers.&mdash;How then&mdash;it may be asked&mdash;do you know that
the highest Brahman is endowed with various powers?&mdash;He is, we
reply, endowed with all powers, 'because that is seen.' For various
scriptural passages declare that the highest divinity possesses all
powers, 'He to whom all actions, all desires, all odours, all
tastes belong, he who embraces all this, who never speaks, and is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page355" id=
"page355"></a>{355}</span> never surprised' (Ch. Up. III, 14, 4);
'He who desires what is true and imagines what is true' (Ch. Up.
VIII, 7, 1); 'He who knows all (in its totality), and cognizes all
(in its detail') (Mu. Up. I, 1, 9); 'By the command of that
Imperishable, O G&aacute;rg&igrave;, sun and moon stand apart'
(B<i>ri</i>. Up. III, 8, 9); and other similar passages.</p>
<p>31. If it be said that (Brahman is devoid of powers) on account
of the absence of organs; (we reply that) this has been explained
(before).</p>
<p>Let this be granted.&mdash;Scripture, however, declares the
highest divinity to be without (bodily) organs of action<a id=
"footnotetag309" name="footnotetag309"></a><a href=
"#footnote309"><sup>309</sup></a>; so, for instance, in the
passage, 'It is without eyes, without ears, without speech, without
mind' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. III, 8, 8). Being such, how should it be
able to produce effects, although it may be endowed with all
powers? For we know (from mantras, arthav&acirc;das, &amp;c.) that
the gods and other intelligent beings, though endowed with all
powers, are capable of producing certain effects only because they
are furnished with bodily instruments of action. And, moreover, how
can the divinity, to whom the scriptural passage, 'No, no,' denies
all attributes, be endowed with all powers?</p>
<p>The appropriate reply to this question has been already given
above. The transcendent highest Brahman can be fathomed by means of
Scripture only, not by mere reasoning. Nor are we obliged to assume
that the capacity of one being is exactly like that which is
observed in another. It has likewise been explained above that
although all qualities are denied of Brahman we nevertheless may
consider it to be endowed with powers, if we assume in its nature
an element of plurality, which is the mere figment of Nescience.
Moreover, a scriptural passage ('Grasping without hands, hastening
without feet, he sees without eyes, he hears without ears'
<i>S</i>ve. Up. III, 19) declares that Brahman <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page356" id="page356"></a>{356}</span> although
devoid of bodily organs, possesses all possible capacities.</p>
<p>32. (Brahman is) not (the creator of the world), on account of
(beings engaging in any action) having a motive.</p>
<p>Another objection is raised against the doctrine of an
intelligent cause of the world.&mdash;The intelligent highest Self
cannot be the creator of the sphere of this world, 'on account of
actions having a purpose.'&mdash;We know from ordinary experience
that man, who is an intelligent being, begins to act after due
consideration only, and does not engage even in an unimportant
undertaking unless it serves some purpose of his own; much less so
in important business. There is also a scriptural passage
confirming this result of common experience, 'Verily everything is
not dear that you may have everything; but that you may love the
Self therefore everything is dear' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. II, 4, 5). Now
the undertaking of creating the sphere of this world, with all its
various contents, is certainly a weighty one. If, then, on the one
hand, you assume it to serve some purpose of the intelligent
highest Self, you thereby sublate its self-sufficiency vouched for
by Scripture; if, on the other hand, you affirm absence of motive
on its part, you must affirm absence of activity also.&mdash;Let us
then assume that just as sometimes an intelligent person when in a
state of frenzy proceeds, owing to his mental aberration, to action
without a motive, so the highest Self also created this world
without any motive.&mdash;That, we reply, would contradict the
omniscience of the highest Self, which is vouched for by
Scripture.&mdash;Hence the doctrine of the creation proceeding from
an intelligent Being is untenable.</p>
<p>33. But (Brahman's creative activity) is mere sport, such as we
see in ordinary life.</p>
<p>The word 'but' discards the objection raised.&mdash;We see in
every-day life that certain doings of princes or other men of high
position who have no unfulfilled desires left have no <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page357" id="page357"></a>{357}</span> reference
to any extraneous purpose; but proceed from mere sportfulness, as,
for instance, their recreations in places of amusement. We further
see that the process of inhalation and exhalation is going on
without reference to any extraneous purpose, merely following the
law of its own nature. Analogously, the activity of the Lord also
may be supposed to be mere sport, proceeding from his own
nature<a id="footnotetag310" name="footnotetag310"></a><a href=
"#footnote310"><sup>310</sup></a>, without reference to any
purpose. For on the ground neither of reason nor of Scripture can
we construe any other purpose of the Lord. Nor can his nature be
questioned.<a id="footnotetag311" name=
"footnotetag311"></a><a href="#footnote311"><sup>311</sup></a>&mdash;Although
the creation of this world appears to us a weighty and difficult
undertaking, it is mere play to the Lord, whose power is unlimited.
And if in ordinary life we might possibly, by close scrutiny,
detect some subtle motive, even for sportful action, we cannot do
so with regard to the actions of the Lord, all whose wishes are
fulfilled, as Scripture says.&mdash;Nor can it be said that he
either does not act or acts like a senseless person; for Scripture
affirms the fact of the creation on the one hand, and the Lord's
omniscience on the other hand. And, finally, we must remember that
the scriptural doctrine of creation does not refer to the highest
reality; it refers to the apparent world only, which is
characterised by name and form, the figments of Nescience, and it,
moreover, aims at intimating that Brahman is the Self of
everything.</p>
<p>34. Inequality (of dispensation) and cruelty (the Lord can) not
(be reproached with), on account of <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page358" id="page358"></a>{358}</span> his regarding (merit and
demerit); for so (Scripture) declares.</p>
<p>In order to strengthen the tenet which we are at present
defending, we follow the procedure of him who shakes a pole planted
in the ground (in order to test whether it is firmly planted), and
raise another objection against the doctrine of the Lord being the
cause of the world.&mdash;The Lord, it is said, cannot be the cause
of the world, because, on that hypothesis, the reproach of
inequality of dispensation and cruelty would attach to him. Some
beings, viz. the gods and others, he renders eminently happy;
others, as for instance the animals, eminently unhappy; to some
again, as for instance men, he allots an intermediate position. To
a Lord bringing about such an unequal condition of things, passion
and malice would have to be ascribed, just as to any common person
acting similarly; which attributes would be contrary to the
essential goodness of the Lord affirmed by <i>S</i>ruti and
Sm<i>ri</i>ti. Moreover, as the infliction of pain and the final
destruction of all creatures would form part of his dispensation,
he would have to be taxed with great cruelty, a quality abhorred by
low people even. For these two reasons Brahman cannot be the cause
of the world.</p>
<p>The Lord, we reply, cannot be reproached with inequality of
dispensation and cruelty, "because he is bound by regards." If the
Lord on his own account, without any extraneous regards, produced
this unequal creation, he would expose himself to blame; but the
fact is, that in creating he is bound by certain regards, i.e. he
has to look to merit and demerit. Hence the circumstance of the
creation being unequal is due to the merit and demerit of the
living creatures created, and is not a fault for which the Lord is
to blame. The position of the Lord is to be looked on as analogous
to that of Parjanya, the Giver of rain. For as Parjanya is the
common cause of the production of rice, barley, and other plants,
while the difference between the various species is due to the
various potentialities lying hidden in the respective seeds, so the
Lord is the common cause of the creation of gods, men, &amp;c.,
while the differences between these classes of beings <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page359" id="page359"></a>{359}</span> are due
to the different merit belonging to the individual souls. Hence the
Lord, being bound by regards, cannot be reproached with inequality
of dispensation and cruelty.&mdash;And if we are asked how we come
to know that the Lord, in creating this world with its various
conditions, is bound by regards, we reply that Scripture declares
that; compare, for instance, the two following passages, 'For he
(the Lord) makes him, whom he wishes to lead up from these worlds,
do a good deed; and the same makes him, whom he wishes to lead down
from these worlds, do a bad deed' (Kaush. Up. III, 8)<a id=
"footnotetag312" name="footnotetag312"></a><a href=
"#footnote312"><sup>312</sup></a>; and, 'A man becomes good by good
work, bad by bad work' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. III, 2, 13). Sm<i>ri</i>ti
passages also declare the favour of the Lord and its opposite to
depend on the different quality of the works of living beings; so,
for instance, 'I serve men in the way in which they approach me'
(Bha. G&icirc;. IV, 11).</p>
<p>35. If it be objected that it (viz. the Lord's having regard to
merit and demerit) is impossible on account of the non-distinction
(of merit and demerit, previous to the first creation); we refute
the objection on the ground of (the world) being without a
beginning.</p>
<p>But&mdash;an objection is raised&mdash;the passage, 'Being only
this was in the beginning, one, without a second,' affirms that
before the creation there was no distinction and consequently no
merit on account of which the creation might have become unequal.
And if we assume the Lord to have been guided in his dispensations
by the actions of living beings subsequent to the creation, we
involve ourselves in the circular reasoning that work depends on
diversity of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page360" id=
"page360"></a>{360}</span> condition of life, and diversity of
condition again on work. The Lord may be considered as acting with
regard to religious merit after distinction had once arisen; but as
before that the cause of inequality, viz. merit, did not exist, it
follows that the first creation must have been free, from
inequalities.</p>
<p>This objection we meet by the remark, that the transmigratory
world is without beginning.&mdash;The objection would be valid if
the world had a beginning; but as it is without beginning, merit
and inequality are, like seed and sprout, caused as well as causes,
and there is therefore no logical objection to their
operation.&mdash;To the question how we know that the world is
without a beginning, the next S&ucirc;tra replies.</p>
<p>36. (The beginninglessness of the world) recommends itself to
reason and is seen (from Scripture).</p>
<p>The beginninglessness of the world recommends itself to reason.
For if it had a beginning it would follow that, the world springing
into existence without a cause, the released souls also would again
enter into the circle of transmigratory existence; and further, as
then there would exist no determining cause of the unequal
dispensation of pleasure and pain, we should have to acquire in the
doctrine of rewards and punishments being allotted, without
reference to previous good or bad action. That the Lord is not the
cause of the inequality, has already been remarked. Nor can
Nescience by itself be the cause, and it is of a uniform nature. On
the other hand, Nescience may be the cause of inequality, if it be
considered as having regard to merit accruing from action produced
by the mental impressions or wrath, hatred, and other afflicting
passions<a id="footnotetag313" name="footnotetag313"></a><a href=
"#footnote313"><sup>313</sup></a>. Without merit and demerit nobody
can enter into existence, and again, without a body merit and
demerit cannot be formed; so that&mdash;on the doctrine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page361" id=
"page361"></a>{361}</span> of the world having a beginning&mdash;we
are led into a logical see-saw. The opposite doctrine, on the other
hand, explains all matters in a manner analogous to the case of the
seed and sprout, so that no difficulty remains.&mdash;Moreover, the
fact of the world being without a beginning, is seen in
<i>S</i>ruti and Sm<i>ri</i>ti. In the first place, we have the
scriptural passage, 'Let me enter with this living Self
(j&icirc;va)', &amp;c. (Ch. Up. VI, 3, 2). Here the circumstance of
the embodied Self (the individual soul) being called, previously to
creation, 'the living Self'&mdash;a name applying to it in so far
as it is the sustaining principle of the
pr&acirc;<i>n</i>as&mdash;shows that this phenomenal world is
without a beginning. For if it had a beginning, the
pr&acirc;<i>n</i>as would not exist before that beginning, and how
then could the embodied Self be denoted, with reference to the time
of the world's beginning, by a name which depends on the existence
of those pr&acirc;<i>n</i>as. Nor can it be said that it is so
designated with a view to its future relation to the
pr&acirc;<i>n</i>as; it being a settled principle that a past
relation, as being already existing, is of greater force than a
mere future relation.&mdash;Moreover, we have the mantra, 'As the
creator formerly devised (akalpaya) sun and moon (<i>Ri</i>.
Sa<i>m</i>h. X, 190, 3), which intimates the existence of former
Kalpas. Sm<i>ri</i>ti also declares the world to be without a
beginning, 'Neither its form is known here, nor its end, nor its
beginning, nor its support' (Bha. G&icirc;. XV, 3). And the
Pur&acirc;<i>n</i>a also declares that there is no measure of the
past and the future Kalpas.</p>
<p>37. And because all the qualities (required in the cause of the
world) are present (in Brahman).</p>
<p>The teacher has now refuted all the objections, such as
difference of character, and the like, which other teachers have
brought forward against what he had established as the real sense
of the Veda, viz. that the intelligent Brahman is the cause and
matter of this world.</p>
<p>Now, before entering on a new chapter, whose chief aim it will
be to refute the (positive) opinions held by other teachers, he
sums up the foregoing chapter, the purport of which <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page362" id="page362"></a>{362}</span> it was to
show why his view should be accepted.&mdash;Because, if that
Brahman is acknowledged as the cause of the world, all attributes
required in the cause (of the world) are seen to be
present&mdash;Brahman being all-knowing, all-powerful, and
possessing the great power of M&acirc;y&acirc;,&mdash;on that
account this our system, founded on the Upanishads, is not open to
any objections.</p>

<h4>SECOND PADA.</h4>
<center>REVERENCE TO THE HIGHEST SELF!</center>
<p>1. That which is inferred (by the S&acirc;@nkhyas, viz. the
pradh&acirc;na) cannot be the cause (of the world), on account of
the orderly arrangement (of the world) being impossible (on that
hypothesis).</p>
<p>Although it is the object of this system to define the true
meaning of the Ved&acirc;nta-texts and not, like the science of
Logic, to establish or refute some tenet by mere ratiocination,
still it is incumbent on thorough students of the Ved&acirc;nta to
refute the S&acirc;@nkhya and other systems which are obstacles in
the way of perfect knowledge. For this purpose a new chapter is
begun. (Nor must it be said that the refutation of the other
systems ought to have preceded the establishment of the
Ved&acirc;nta position; for) as the determination of the sense of
the Ved&acirc;nta-passages directly subserves perfect knowledge, we
have at first, by means of such a determination, established our
own position, since this is a task more important than the
refutation of the views entertained by others.</p>
<p>Here an opponent might come forward and say that we are indeed
entitled to establish our own position, so as to define perfect
knowledge which is the means of release to those desirous of it,
but that no use is apparent of a refutation of other opinions, a
proceeding productive of nothing but hate and anger.&mdash;There is
a use, we reply. For there is some danger of men of inferior
intelligence looking upon the S&acirc;@nkhya and similar systems as
requisite for perfect knowledge, because those systems have a
weighty appearance, have been adopted by authoritative persons, and
profess to lead to perfect knowledge. Such people might therefore
think that those systems with their abstruse arguments <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page364" id="page364"></a>{364}</span> were
propounded by omniscient sages, and might on that account have
faith in them. For this reason we must endeavour to demonstrate
their intrinsic worthlessness.</p>
<p>But, it might be said, the S&acirc;@nkhya and similar systems
have already been impugned in several S&ucirc;tras of the first
adhy&acirc;ya (I, 1, 5, 18; I, 4, 28); why, then, controvert them
again?&mdash;The task&mdash;we reply&mdash;which we are now about
to undertake differs from what we have already accomplished. As the
S&acirc;@nkhyas and other philosophers also quote, in order to
establish their own positions, the Ved&acirc;nta-passages and
interpret them in such a manner as to make them agree with their
own systems, we have hitherto endeavoured to show that their
interpretations are altogether fallacious. Now, however, we are
going to refute their arguments in an independent manner, without
any reference to the Ved&acirc;nta-texts.</p>
<p>The S&acirc;@nkhyas, to make a beginning with them, argue as
follows.&mdash;Just as jars, dishes, and other products which
possess the common quality of consisting of clay are seen to have
for their cause clay in general; so we must suppose that all the
outward and inward (i.e. inanimate and animate) effects which are
endowed with the characteristics of pleasure, pain, and
dulness<a id="footnotetag314" name="footnotetag314"></a><a href=
"#footnote314"><sup>314</sup></a> have for their causes pleasure,
pain, and dulness in general. Pleasure, pain, and dulness in their
generality together constitute the threefold pradh&acirc;na. This
pradh&acirc;na which is non-intelligent evolves itself
spontaneously into multiform modifications<a id="footnotetag315"
name="footnotetag315"></a><a href=
"#footnote315"><sup>315</sup></a>, in order thus to effect the
purposes (i.e. enjoyment, release, and so on) of the intelligent
soul.&mdash;The existence of the pradh&acirc;na is to be inferred
from other circumstances also, such as the limitation of all
effects and the like<a id="footnotetag316" name=
"footnotetag316"></a><a href="#footnote316"><sup>316</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Against this doctrine we argue as follows.&mdash;If you
S&acirc;nkhyas base your theory on parallel instances merely, we
point <span class="pagenum"><a name="page365" id=
"page365"></a>{365}</span> out that a non-intelligent thing which,
without being guided by an intelligent being, spontaneously
produces effects capable of subserving the purposes of some
particular person is nowhere observed in the world. We rather
observe that houses, palaces, couches, pleasure-grounds, and the
like&mdash;things which according to circumstances are conducive to
the obtainment of pleasure or the avoidance of pain&mdash;are made
by workmen endowed with intelligence. Now look at this entire world
which appears, on the one hand, as external (i.e. inanimate) in the
form of earth and the other elements enabling (the souls) to enjoy
the fruits of their various actions, and, on the other hand, as
animate, in the form of bodies which belong to the different
classes of beings, possess a definite arrangement of organs, and
are therefore capable of constituting the abodes of fruition; look,
we say, at this world, of which the most ingenious workmen cannot
even form a conception in their minds, and then say if a
non-intelligent principle like the pradh&acirc;na is able to
fashion it! Other non-intelligent things such as stones and clods
of earth are certainly not seen to possess analogous powers. We
rather must assume that just as clay and similar substances are
seen to fashion themselves into various forms, if worked upon by
potters and the like, so the pradh&acirc;na also (when modifying
itself into its effects) is ruled by some intelligent principle.
When endeavouring to determine the nature of the primal cause (of
the world), there is no need for us to take our stand on those
attributes only which form part of the nature of material causes
such as clay, &amp;c., and not on those also which belong to
extraneous agents such as potters, &amp;c.<a id="footnotetag317"
name="footnotetag317"></a><a href="#footnote317"><sup>317</sup></a>
Nor (if remembering this latter point) do we enter into conflict
with any means of right knowledge; we, on the contrary, are in
direct agreement with Scripture which teaches that an intelligent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page366" id=
"page366"></a>{366}</span> cause exists.&mdash;For the reason
detailed in the above, i.e. on account of the impossibility of the
'orderly arrangement' (of the world), a non-intelligent cause of
the world is not to be inferred.&mdash;The word 'and' (in the
S&ucirc;tra) adds other reasons on account of which the
pradh&acirc;na cannot be inferred, viz. 'on account of the
non-possibility of endowment,' &amp;c. For it cannot be
maintained<a id="footnotetag318" name="footnotetag318"></a><a href=
"#footnote318"><sup>318</sup></a> that all outward and inward
effects are 'endowed' with the nature of pleasure, pain, and
dulness, because pleasure, &amp;c. are known as inward (mental)
states, while sound, &amp;c. (i.e. the sense-objects) are known as
being of a different nature (i.e. as outward things), and moreover
as being the operative causes of pleasure, &amp;c.<a id=
"footnotetag319" name="footnotetag319"></a><a href=
"#footnote319"><sup>319</sup></a> And, further, although the
sense-object such as sound and so on is one, yet we observe that
owing to the difference of the mental impressions (produced by it)
differences exist in the effects it produces, one person being
affected by it pleasantly, another painfully, and so on<a id=
"footnotetag320" name="footnotetag320"></a><a href=
"#footnote320"><sup>320</sup></a>.&mdash;(Turning to the next
S&acirc;@nkhya argument which infers the existence of the
pradh&acirc;na from the limitation of all effects), we remark that
he who concludes that all inward and outward effects depend on a
conjunction of several things, because they are limited (a
conclusion based on the observation that some limited effects such
as roof and sprout, &amp;c. depend on the conjunction of several
things), is driven to the conclusion that the three constituents of
the pradh&acirc;na, viz. Goodness, Passion, and Darkness, likewise
depend on the conjunction of several <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page367" id="page367"></a>{367}</span> antecedents<a id=
"footnotetag321" name="footnotetag321"></a><a href=
"#footnote321"><sup>321</sup></a>; for they also are limited<a id=
"footnotetag322" name="footnotetag322"></a><a href=
"#footnote322"><sup>322</sup></a>.&mdash;Further<a id=
"footnotetag323" name="footnotetag323"></a><a href=
"#footnote323"><sup>323</sup></a>, it is impossible to use the
relation of cause and effect as a reason for assuming that all
effects whatever have a non-intelligent principle for their
antecedent; for we have shown already that that relation exists in
the case of couches and chairs also, over whose production
intelligence presides.</p>
<p>2. And on account of (the impossibility of) activity.</p>
<p>Leaving the arrangement of the world, we now pass on to the
activity by which it is produced.&mdash;The three gu<i>n</i>as,
passing out of the state of equipoise and entering into the
condition of mutual subordination and superordination, originate
activities tending towards the production of particular
effects.&mdash;Now these activities also cannot be ascribed to a
non-intelligent pradh&acirc;na left to itself, as no such activity
is seen in clay and similar substances, or in chariots and the
like. For we observe that clay and the like, and
chariots&mdash;which are in their own nature
non-intelligent&mdash;enter on activities tending towards
particular effects only when they are acted upon by intelligent
beings such as potters, &amp;c. in the one case, and horses and the
like in the other case. From what is seen we determine what is not
seen. Hence a non-intelligent cause of the world is not to be
inferred because, on that hypothesis, the activity without which
the world cannot be produced would be impossible.</p>
<p>But, the S&acirc;@nkhya rejoins, we do likewise not observe
activity on the part of mere intelligent beings.&mdash;True; we
however see activity on the part of non-intelligent things such as
chariots and the like when they are in conjunction with intelligent
beings.&mdash;But, the S&acirc;@nkhya again objects, we never
actually observe activity on the part of an intelligent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page368" id=
"page368"></a>{368}</span> being even when in conjunction with a
non-intelligent thing.&mdash;Very well; the question then arises:
Does the activity belong to that in which it is actually observed
(as the S&acirc;@nkhya says), or to that on account of the
conjunction with which it is observed (as the Ved&acirc;ntin
avers)?&mdash;We must, the S&acirc;@nkhya replies, attribute
activity to that in which it is actually seen, since both (i.e. the
activity and its abode) are matter of observation. A mere
intelligent being, on the other hand, is never observed as the
abode of activity while a chariot is. The<a id="footnotetag324"
name="footnotetag324"></a><a href="#footnote324"><sup>324</sup></a>
existence of an intelligent Self joined to a body and so on which
are the abode of activity can be established (by inference) only;
the inference being based on the difference observed between living
bodies and mere non-intelligent things, such as chariots and the
like. For this very reason, viz. that intelligence is observed only
where a body is observed while it is never seen without a body, the
Materialists consider intelligence to be a mere attribute of the
body.&mdash;Hence activity belongs only to what is
non-intelligent.</p>
<p>To all this we&mdash;the Ved&acirc;ntins&mdash;make the
following reply.&mdash;We do not mean to say that activity does not
belong to those non-intelligent things in which it is observed; it
does indeed belong to them; but it results from an intelligent
principle, because it exists when the latter is present and does
not exist when the latter is absent. Just as the effects of burning
and shining, which have their abode in wood and similar material,
are indeed not observed when there is mere fire (i.e. are not due
to mere fire; as mere fire, i.e. fire without wood, &amp;c., does
not exist), but at the same time result from fire only as they are
seen when fire is present and are not seen when fire is absent; so,
as the Materialists also admit, only intelligent bodies are
observed <span class="pagenum"><a name="page369" id=
"page369"></a>{369}</span> to be the movers of chariots and other
non-intelligent things. The motive power of intelligence is
therefore incontrovertible.&mdash;But&mdash;an objection will be
raised&mdash;your Self even if joined to a body is incapable of
exercising moving power, for motion cannot be effected by that the
nature of which is pure intelligence.&mdash;A thing, we reply,
which is itself devoid of motion may nevertheless move other
things. The magnet is itself devoid of motion, and yet it moves
iron; and colours and the other objects of sense, although
themselves devoid of motion, produce movements in the eyes and the
other organs of sense. So the Lord also who is all-present, the
Self of all, all-knowing and all-powerful may, although himself
unmoving, move the universe.&mdash;If it finally be objected that
(on the Ved&acirc;nta doctrine) there is no room for a moving power
as in consequence of the oneness (aduality) of Brahman no motion
can take place; we reply that such objections have repeatedly been
refuted by our pointing to the fact of the Lord being fictitiously
connected with M&acirc;y&acirc;, which consists of name and form
presented by Nescience.&mdash;Hence motion can be reconciled with
the doctrine of an all-knowing first cause; but not with the
doctrine of a non-intelligent first cause.</p>
<p>3. If it be said (that the pradh&acirc;na moves) like milk or
water, (we reply that) there also (the motion is due to
intelligence).</p>
<p>Well, the S&acirc;@nkhya resumes, listen then to the following
instances.&mdash;As non-sentient milk flows forth from its own
nature merely for the nourishment of the young animal, and as
non-sentient water, from its own nature, flows along for the
benefit of mankind, so the pradh&acirc;na also, although
non-intelligent, may be supposed to move from its own nature merely
for the purpose of effecting the highest end of man.</p>
<p>This argumentation, we reply, is unsound again; for as the
adherents of both doctrines admit that motion is not observed in
the case of merely non-intelligent things such as chariots,
&amp;c., we infer that water and milk also move only because they
are directed by intelligent powers. Scriptural passages, moreover
(such as 'He who dwells in <span class="pagenum"><a name="page370"
id="page370"></a>{370}</span> the water and within the water, who
rules the water within,' B<i>ri</i>. Up. III, 7, 4; and, 'By the
command of that Akshara, O G&acirc;rg&icirc;, some rivers flow to
the East,' &amp;c., B<i>ri</i>. Up. III, 8, 9), declare that
everything in this world which flows is directed by the Lord. Hence
the instances of milk and water as belonging themselves to that
class of cases which prove our general principle<a id=
"footnotetag325" name="footnotetag325"></a><a href=
"#footnote325"><sup>325</sup></a> cannot be used to show that the
latter is too wide.&mdash;Moreover, the cow, which is an
intelligent being and loves her calf, makes her milk flow by her
wish to do so, and the milk is in addition drawn forth by the
sucking of the calf. Nor does water move either with absolute
independence&mdash;for its flow depends on the declivity of the
soil and similar circumstances&mdash;or independently of an
intelligent principle, for we have shown that the latter is present
in all cases.&mdash;If, finally, our opponent should point to
S&ucirc;tra II, 1, 24 as contradicting the present S&ucirc;tra, we
remark that there we have merely shown on the ground of ordinary
experience that an effect may take place in itself independently of
any external instrumental cause; a conclusion which does not
contradict the doctrine, based on Scripture, that all effects
depend on the Lord.</p>
<p>4. And because (the pradh&acirc;na), on account of there
existing nothing beyond it, stands in no relation; (it cannot be
active.)</p>
<p>The three gu<i>n</i>as of the S&acirc;@nkhyas when in a state of
equipoise form the pradh&acirc;na. Beyond the pradh&acirc;na there
exists no external principle which could either impel the
pradh&acirc;na to activity or restrain it from activity. The soul
(purusha), as we know, is indifferent, neither moves to&mdash;nor
restrains from&mdash;action. As therefore the pradh&acirc;na stands
in no relation, it is impossible to see why it should sometimes
modify itself into the great principle (mahat) and sometimes not.
The activity and non-activity (by turns) of the Lord, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page371" id="page371"></a>{371}</span> on the
other hand, are not contrary to reason, on account of his
omniscience and omnipotence, and his being connected with the power
of illusion (m&acirc;ya).</p>
<p>5. Nor (can it be said that the pradh&acirc;na modifies itself
spontaneously) like grass, &amp;c. (which turn into milk); for
(milk) does not exist elsewhere (but in the female animal).</p>
<p>Let this be (the S&acirc;@nkhya resumes). Just as grass, herbs,
water, &amp;c. independently of any other instrumental cause
transform themselves, by their own nature, into milk; so, we
assume, the pradh&acirc;na also transforms itself into the great
principle, and so on. And, if you ask how we know that grass
transforms itself independently of any instrumental cause; we
reply, 'Because no such cause is observed.' For if we did perceive
some such cause, we certainly should apply it to grass, &amp;c.
according to our liking, and thereby produce milk. But as a matter
of fact we do no such thing. Hence the transformation of grass and
the like must be considered to be due to its own nature merely; and
we may infer therefrom that the transformation of the
pradh&acirc;na is of the same kind.</p>
<p>To this we make the following reply.&mdash;The transformation of
the pradh&acirc;na might be ascribed to its own nature merely if we
really could admit that grass modifies itself in the manner stated
by you; but we are unable to admit that, since another instrumental
cause is observed. How? 'Because it does not exist elsewhere.' For
grass becomes milk only when it is eaten by a cow or some other
female animal, not if it is left either uneaten or is eaten by a
bull. If the transformation had no special cause, grass would
become milk even on other conditions than that of entering a cow's
body. Nor would the circumstance of men not being able to produce
milk according to their liking prove that there is no instrumental
cause; for while some effects can be produced by men, others result
from divine action only<a id="footnotetag326" name=
"footnotetag326"></a><a href="#footnote326"><sup>326</sup></a>. The
fact, however, is that men also are able, by <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page372" id="page372"></a>{372}</span> applying
a means in their power, to produce milk from grass and herbs; for
when they wish to procure a more abundant supply of milk they feed
the cow more plentifully and thus obtain more milk from
her.&mdash;For these reasons the spontaneous modification of the
pradh&acirc;na cannot be proved from the instance of grass and the
like.</p>
<p>6. Even if we admit (the S&acirc;@nkhya position refuted in what
precedes, it is invalidated by other objections) on account of the
absence of a purpose (on the part of the pradh&acirc;na).</p>
<p>Even if we, accommodating ourselves to your (the
S&acirc;@nkhya's) belief, should admit what has been disproved in
the preceding S&ucirc;tra, viz. that the pradh&acirc;na is
spontaneously active, still your opinion would lie open to an
objection 'on account of the absence of a purpose.' For if the
spontaneous activity of the pradh&acirc;na has, as you say, no
reference to anything else, it will have no reference not only to
any aiding principle, but also to any purpose or motive, and
consequently your doctrine that the pradh&acirc;na is active in
order to effect the purpose of man will become untenable. If you
reply that the pradh&acirc;na does not indeed regard any aiding
principle, but does regard a purpose, we remark that in that case
we must distinguish between the different possible purposes, viz.
either enjoyment (on the part of the soul), or final release, or
both. If enjoyment, what enjoyment, we ask, can belong to the soul
which is naturally incapable of any accretion (of pleasure or
pain)<a id="footnotetag327" name="footnotetag327"></a><a href=
"#footnote327"><sup>327</sup></a>? Moreover, there would in that
case be no opportunity for release<a id="footnotetag328" name=
"footnotetag328"></a><a href=
"#footnote328"><sup>328</sup></a>.&mdash;If release, then the
activity of the pradh&acirc;na would be purposeless, as even
antecedently to it the soul is in the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page373" id="page373"></a>{373}</span> state of
release; moreover, there would then be no occasion for the
perception of sounds, &amp;c.<a id="footnotetag329" name=
"footnotetag329"></a><a href=
"#footnote329"><sup>329</sup></a>&mdash;If both, then, on account
of the infinite number of the objects of pradh&acirc;na to be
enjoyed (by the soul)<a id="footnotetag330" name=
"footnotetag330"></a><a href="#footnote330"><sup>330</sup></a>,
there would be no opportunity for final release. Nor can the
satisfaction of a desire be considered as the purpose of the
activity of the pradh&acirc;na; for neither the non-intelligent
pradh&acirc;na nor the essentially pure soul can feel any
desire.&mdash;If, finally, you should assume the pradh&acirc;na to
be active, because otherwise the power of sight (belonging to the
soul on account of its intelligent nature) and the creative power
(belonging to the pradh&acirc;na) would be purposeless; it would
follow that, as the creative power of the pradh&acirc;na does not
cease at any time any more than the soul's power of sight does, the
apparent world would never come to an end, so that no final release
of the soul could take place<a id="footnotetag331" name=
"footnotetag331"></a><a href=
"#footnote331"><sup>331</sup></a>.&mdash;It is, therefore,
impossible to maintain that the pradh&acirc;na enters on its
activity for the purposes of the soul.</p>
<p>7. And if you say (that the soul may move the pradh&acirc;na) as
the (lame) man (moves the blind one) or as the magnet (moves the
iron); thus also (the difficulty is not overcome).</p>
<p>Well then&mdash;the S&acirc;@nkhya resumes, endeavouring to
defend his position by parallel instances&mdash;let us say that, as
some lame man devoid of the power of motion, but possessing the
power of sight, having mounted the back of a blind man who is able
to move but not to see, makes the latter move; or as the magnet not
moving itself, moves the iron, so the soul moves the
pradh&acirc;na.&mdash;Thus also, we reply, you do not free your
doctrine from all shortcomings; for this your new position involves
an abandonment of your old <span class="pagenum"><a name="page374"
id="page374"></a>{374}</span> position, according to which the
pradh&acirc;na is moving of itself, and the (indifferent, inactive)
soul possesses no moving power. And how should the indifferent soul
move the pradh&acirc;na? A man, although lame, may make a blind man
move by means of words and the like; but the soul which is devoid
of action and qualities cannot possibly put forth any moving
energy. Nor can it be said that it moves the pradh&acirc;na by its
mere proximity as the magnet moves the iron; for from the
permanency of proximity (of soul and pradh&acirc;na) a permanency
of motion would follow. The proximity of the magnet, on the other
hand (to the iron), is not permanent, but depends on a certain
activity and the adjustment of the magnet in a certain position;
hence the (lame) man and the magnet do not supply really parallel
instances.&mdash;The pradh&acirc;na then being non-intelligent and
the soul indifferent, and there being no third principle to connect
them, there can be no connexion of the two. If we attempted to
establish a connexion on the ground of capability (of being seen on
the part of the pradh&acirc;na, of seeing on the part of the soul),
the permanency of such capability would imply the impossibility of
final release.&mdash;Moreover, here as well as before (in the
preceding S&ucirc;tra) the different alternatives connected with
the absence of purpose (on the pradh&acirc;na's part) have to be
considered<a id="footnotetag332" name="footnotetag332"></a><a href=
"#footnote332"><sup>332</sup></a>.&mdash;The highest Self, on the
other hand (which is the cause of the world, according to the
Ved&acirc;ntins), is characterised by non-activity inherent in its
own nature, and, at the same time, by moving power inherent in
M&acirc;y&acirc; and is thus superior (to the soul of the
S&acirc;@nkhyas).</p>
<p>8. And, again, (the pradh&acirc;na cannot be active) because the
relation of principal (and subordinate matter) is impossible
(between the three gu<i>n</i>as).</p>
<p>For the following reason also activity on the part of the
pradh&acirc;na is not possible.&mdash;The condition of the
pradh&acirc;na <span class="pagenum"><a name="page375" id=
"page375"></a>{375}</span> consists in the three gu<i>n</i>as, viz.
goodness, passion, and darkness, abiding in themselves in a state
of equipoise without standing to one another in the relation of
mutual superiority or inferiority. In that state the gu<i>n</i>as
cannot possibly enter into the relation of mutual subserviency
because thereby they would forfeit their essential characteristic,
viz. absolute independence. And as there exists no extraneous
principle to stir up the gu<i>n</i>as, the production of the great
principle and the other effects&mdash;which would acquire for its
operative cause a non-balanced state of the gu<i>n</i>as&mdash;is
impossible.</p>
<p>9. And although another inference be made, (the objections
remain in force) on account of the (pradh&acirc;na) being devoid of
the power of intelligence.</p>
<p>But&mdash;the S&acirc;@nkhya resumes&mdash;we draw another
inference, so as to leave no room for the objection just stated. We
do not acknowledge the gu<i>n</i>as to be characterised by absolute
irrelativity and unchangeableness, since there is no proof for such
an assumption. We rather infer the characteristics of the
gu<i>n</i>as from those of their effects, presuming that their
nature must be such as to render the production of the effects
possible. Now the gu<i>n</i>as are admitted to be of an unsteady
nature; hence the gu<i>n</i>as themselves are able to enter into
the relation of mutual inequality, even while they are in a state
of equipoise.</p>
<p>Even in that case, we reply, the objections stated above which
were founded on the impossibility of an orderly arrangement of the
world, &amp;c., remain in force on account of the pradh&acirc;na
being devoid of the power of intelligence. And if (to escape those
objections) the S&acirc;@nkhya should infer (from the orderly
arrangement of the world, &amp;c.), that the primal cause is
intelligent, he would cease to be an antagonist, since the doctrine
that there is one intelligent cause of this multiform world would
be nothing else but the Ved&acirc;ntic doctrine of
Brahman.&mdash;Moreover, if the gu<i>n</i>as were capable of
entering into the relation of mutual inequality even while in the
state of equipoise, one of two <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page376" id="page376"></a>{376}</span> things would happen; they
would either not be in the condition of inequality on account of
the absence of an operative cause; or else, if they were in that
condition, they would always remain in it; the absence of an
operative cause being a non-changing circumstance. And thus the
doctrine would again be open to the objection stated before<a id=
"footnotetag333" name="footnotetag333"></a><a href=
"#footnote333"><sup>333</sup></a>.</p>
<p>10. And moreover (the S&acirc;@nkhya doctrine) is objectionable
on account of its contradictions.</p>
<p>The doctrine of the S&acirc;@nkhyas, moreover, is full of
contradictions. Sometimes they enumerate seven senses, sometimes
eleven<a id="footnotetag334" name="footnotetag334"></a><a href=
"#footnote334"><sup>334</sup></a>. In some places they teach that
the subtle elements of material things proceed from the great
principle, in other places again that they proceed from
self-consciousness. Sometimes they speak of three internal organs,
sometimes of one only<a id="footnotetag335" name=
"footnotetag335"></a><a href="#footnote335"><sup>335</sup></a>.
That their doctrine, moreover, contradicts <i>S</i>ruti, which
teaches that the Lord is the cause of the world, and Sm<i>ri</i>ti,
based on <i>S</i>ruti, is well known.&mdash;For these reasons also
the S&acirc;@nkhya system is objectionable.</p>
<p>Here the S&acirc;@nkhya again brings a countercharge&mdash;The
system of the Ved&acirc;ntins also, he says, must be declared to be
objectionable; for it does not admit that that which suffers and
that which causes suffering<a id="footnotetag336" name=
"footnotetag336"></a><a href="#footnote336"><sup>336</sup></a> are
different classes of things (and thereby renders futile the
well-established distinction of causes of suffering and suffering
beings). For <span class="pagenum"><a name="page377" id=
"page377"></a>{377}</span> those who admit the one Brahman to be
the Self of everything and the cause of the whole world, have to
admit also that the two attributes of being that which causes
suffering and that which suffers belong to the one supreme Self
(not to different classes of beings). If, then, these two
attributes belong to one and the same Self, it never can divest
itself of them, and thus Scripture, which teaches perfect knowledge
for the purpose of the cessation of all suffering, loses all its
meaning. For&mdash;to adduce a parallel case&mdash;a lamp as long
as it subsists as such is never divested of the two qualities of
giving heat and light. And if the Ved&acirc;ntin should adduce the
case of water with its waves, ripples, foam, &amp;c.<a id=
"footnotetag337" name="footnotetag337"></a><a href=
"#footnote337"><sup>337</sup></a>, we remark that there also the
waves, &amp;c. constitute attributes of the water which remain
permanently, although they by turns manifest themselves, and again
enter into the state of non-manifestation; hence the water is never
really destitute of waves, not any more than the lamp is ever
destitute of heat and light.&mdash;That that which causes
suffering, and that which suffers constitute different classes of
things is, moreover, well known from ordinary experience. For (to
consider the matter from a more general point of view) the person
desiring and the thing desired<a id="footnotetag338" name=
"footnotetag338"></a><a href="#footnote338"><sup>338</sup></a> are
understood to be separate existences. If the object of desire were
not essentially different and separate from the person desiring,
the state of being desirous could not be ascribed to the latter,
because the object with reference to which alone he can be called
desiring would already essentially be established in him (belong to
him). The latter state of things exists in the case of a lamp and
its light, for instance. Light essentially belongs to the lamp, and
hence the latter never can stand in want of light; for want or
desire can exist only if the thing wanted or desired is not yet
obtained.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page378" id=
"page378"></a>{378}</span>
<p>(And just as there could be no desiring person, if the object of
desire and the desiring person were not essentially separate), so
the object of desire also would cease to be an object for the
desiring person, and would be an object for itself only. As a
matter of fact, however, this is not the case; for the two ideas
(and terms), 'object of desire' and 'desiring person,' imply a
relation (are correlative), and a relation exists in two things,
not in one only. Hence the desiring person and the object of desire
are separate.&mdash;The same holds good with regard to what is not
desired (object of aversion; anartha) and the non-desiring person
(anarthin).</p>
<p>An object of desire is whatever is of advantage to the desiring
person, an object of aversion whatever is of disadvantage; with
both one person enters into relation by turns. On account of the
comparative paucity of the objects of desire, and the comparative
multitude of the objects of aversion, both may be comprised under
the general term, 'object of aversion.' Now, these objects of
aversion we mean when we use the term 'causes of suffering,' while
by the term 'sufferer' we understand the soul which, being one,
enters into successive relations with both (i.e. the objects of
desire and the objects of aversion). If, then, the causes of
suffering and the sufferer constitute one Self (as the
Ved&acirc;nta teaches), it follows that final release is
impossible.&mdash;But if, on the other hand, the two are assumed to
constitute separate classes, the possibility of release is not
excluded, since the cause of the connexion of the two (viz. wrong
knowledge) may be removed.</p>
<p>All this reasoning&mdash;we, the Ved&acirc;ntins, reply&mdash;is
futile, because on account of the unity of the Self the relation,
whose two terms are the causes of suffering, and the sufferer
cannot exist (in the Self).&mdash;Our doctrine would be liable to
your objection if that which causes suffering and that which
suffers did, while belonging to one and the same Self, stand to
each other in the relation of object and subject. But they do not
stand in that relation just because they are one. If fire, although
it possesses different attributes, such as heat and light, and is
capable of change, does neither burn nor illumine itself since it
is one only; how can the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page379"
id="page379"></a>{379}</span> one unchangeable Brahman enter with
reference to itself into the relation of cause of suffering and
sufferer?&mdash;Where then, it may be asked, does the relation
discussed (which after all cannot be denied altogether)
exist?&mdash;That, we reply, is not difficult to see<a id=
"footnotetag339" name="footnotetag339"></a><a href=
"#footnote339"><sup>339</sup></a>. The living body which is the
object of the action of burning is the sufferer; the sun, for
instance, is a cause of suffering (burning).&mdash;But, the
opponent rejoins, burning is a pain, and as such can affect an
intelligent being only, not the non-intelligent body; for if it
were an affection of the mere body, it would, on the destruction of
the body, cease of itself, so that it would be needless to seek for
means to make it cease.&mdash;But it is likewise not observed, we
reply, that a mere intelligent being destitute of a body is burned
and suffers pain.&mdash;Nor would you (the S&acirc;@nkhya) also
assume that the affection called burning belongs to a mere
intelligent being. Nor can you admit<a id="footnotetag340" name=
"footnotetag340"></a><a href="#footnote340"><sup>340</sup></a> a
real connexion of the soul and the body, because through such a
connexion impurity and similar imperfections would attach to the
soul<a id="footnotetag341" name="footnotetag341"></a><a href=
"#footnote341"><sup>341</sup></a>. Nor can suffering itself be said
to suffer. And how then, we ask, can you explain the relation
existing between a sufferer and the causes of suffering? If (as a
last refuge) you should maintain that the sattva-gu<i>n</i>a is
that which suffers, and the gu<i>n</i>a called passion that which
causes suffering, we again object, because the intelligent
principle (the soul) cannot be really connected with these
two<a id="footnotetag342" name="footnotetag342"></a><a href=
"#footnote342"><sup>342</sup></a>. And if you should say that the
soul suffers as it were because it leans towards<a id=
"footnotetag343" name="footnotetag343"></a><a href=
"#footnote343"><sup>343</sup></a> the sattva-gu<i>n</i>a, we point
out that the employment of the phrase, 'as it were,' shows that the
soul does not really suffer.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page380" id=

<p>If it is understood that its suffering is not real, we do not
object to the phrase 'as it were<a id="footnotetag344" name=

For the amphisbena also does not become venomous because it is 'a
serpent as it were' ('like a serpent'), nor does the serpent lose
its venom because it is 'like an amphisbena.' You must therefore
admit that the relation of causes of suffering and of sufferers is
not real, but the effect of Nescience. And if you admit, that, then
my (the Ved&acirc;ntic) doctrine also is free from objections<a id=
"footnotetag345" name="footnotetag345"></a><a href=
"#footnote345"><sup>345</sup></a>.</p>
<p>But perhaps you (the S&acirc;@nkhya) will say that, after all,
suffering (on the part of the soul) is real<a id="footnotetag346"
name="footnotetag346"></a><a href=
"#footnote346"><sup>346</sup></a>. In that case, however, the
impossibility of release is all the more undeniable<a id=
"footnotetag347" name="footnotetag347"></a><a href=
"#footnote347"><sup>347</sup></a>, especially as the cause of
suffering (viz. the pradh&acirc;na) is admitted to be
eternal.&mdash;And if (to get out of this difficulty) you maintain
that, although the potentialities of suffering (on the part of the
soul) and of causing suffering (on the part of the pradh&acirc;na)
are eternal, yet suffering, in order to become actual, requires the
conjunction of the two&mdash;which conjunction in its turn depends
on a special reason, viz. the non-discrimination of the
pradh&acirc;na by the soul&mdash;and that hence, when that reason
no longer exists, the conjunction of the two comes to an absolute
termination, whereby the absolute release of the soul becomes
possible; we are again unable to accept your explanation, because
that on which the non-discrimination depends, viz. the gu<i>n</i>a,
called Darkness, is acknowledged by you to be eternal.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page381" id=
"page381"></a>{381}</span>
<p>And as<a id="footnotetag348" name="footnotetag348"></a><a href=
"#footnote348"><sup>348</sup></a> there is no fixed rule for the
(successive) rising and sinking of the influence of the particular
gu<i>n</i>as, there is also no fixed rule for the termination of
the cause which effects the conjunction of soul and pradh&acirc;na
(i.e. non-discrimination); hence the disjunction of the two is
uncertain, and so the S&acirc;@nkhyas cannot escape the reproach of
absence of final release resulting from their doctrine. To the
Ved&acirc;ntin, on the other hand, the idea of final release being
impossible cannot occur in his dreams even; for the Self he
acknowledges to be one only, and one thing cannot enter into the
relation of subject and object, and Scripture, moreover, declares
that the plurality of effects originates from speech only. For the
phenomenal world, on the other hand, we may admit the relation of
sufferer and suffering just as it is observed, and need neither
object to it nor refute it.</p>
<p>Herewith we have refuted the doctrine which holds the
pradh&acirc;na to be the cause of the world. We have now to dispose
of the atomic theory.</p>
<p>We begin by refuting an objection raised by the atomists against
the upholders of Brahman.&mdash;The Vai<i>s</i>eshikas argue as
follows: The qualities which inhere in the substance constituting
the cause originate qualities of the same kind in the substance
constituting the effect; we see, for instance, that from white
threads white cloth is produced, but do not observe what is
contrary (viz. white threads resulting in a piece of cloth of a
different colour). Hence, if the intelligent Brahman is assumed as
the cause of the world, we should expect to find intelligence
inherent in the effect also, viz. the world. But this is not the
case, and consequently the intelligent Brahman cannot be the cause
of the world.&mdash;This reasoning the S&ucirc;trak&acirc;ra shows
to be fallacious, on the ground of the system of the
Vai<i>s</i>eshikas themselves.</p>
<p>II. Or (the world may originate from Brahman) <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page382" id="page382"></a>{382}</span> as the
great and the long originate from the short and the atomic.</p>
<p>The system of the Vai<i>s</i>eshikas is the following:&mdash;The
atoms which possess, according to their special kind<a id=
"footnotetag349" name="footnotetag349"></a><a href=
"#footnote349"><sup>349</sup></a>, the qualities of colour,
&amp;c., and which are of spherical form<a id="footnotetag350"
name="footnotetag350"></a><a href=
"#footnote350"><sup>350</sup></a>, subsist during a certain
period<a id="footnotetag351" name="footnotetag351"></a><a href=
"#footnote351"><sup>351</sup></a> without producing any
effects<a id="footnotetag352" name="footnotetag352"></a><a href=
"#footnote352"><sup>352</sup></a>. After that, the unseen principle
(ad<i>ri</i>sh<i>ta</i>), &amp;c.<a id="footnotetag353" name=
"footnotetag353"></a><a href="#footnote353"><sup>353</sup></a>,
acting as operative causes and conjunction constituting the
non-inherent cause<a id="footnotetag354" name=
"footnotetag354"></a><a href="#footnote354"><sup>354</sup></a>,
they produce the entire aggregate of effected things, beginning
with binary atomic compounds. At the same time the qualities of the
causes (i.e. of the simple atoms) produce corresponding qualities
in the effects. Thus, when two atoms produce a binary atomic
compound, the special qualities belonging to the simple atoms, such
as white colour, &amp;c., produce a corresponding white colour in
the binary compound. One special quality, however, of the simple
atoms, viz. atomic sphericity, does not produce corresponding
sphericity in the binary compound; for the forms of extension
belonging to the latter are said to be minuteness (a<i>n</i>utva)
and shortness. And, again, when two binary compounds combining
produce a quaternary atomic compound, the qualities, such as
whiteness, &amp;c., inherent in the binary compounds produce
corresponding qualities in the quaternary compounds; with the
exception, however, of the two qualities of minuteness and
shortness. For it is <span class="pagenum"><a name="page383" id=
"page383"></a>{383}</span> admitted that the forms of extension
belonging to quaternary compounds are not minuteness and shortness,
but bigness (mahattva) and length. The same happens<a id=
"footnotetag355" name="footnotetag355"></a><a href=
"#footnote355"><sup>355</sup></a> when many simple atoms or many
binary compounds or a simple atom and a binary compound combine to
produce new effects.</p>
<p>Well, then, we say, just as from spherical atoms binary
compounds are produced, which are minute and short, and ternary
compounds which are big and long, but not anything spherical; or as
from binary compounds, which are minute and short, ternary
compounds, &amp;c., are produced which are big and long, not minute
and short; so this non-intelligent world may spring from the
intelligent Brahman. This is a doctrine to which you&mdash;the
Vai<i>s</i>eshika&mdash;cannot, on your own principles, object.</p>
<p>Here the Vai<i>s</i>eshika will perhaps come forward with the
following argumentation<a id="footnotetag356" name=
"footnotetag356"></a><a href="#footnote356"><sup>356</sup></a>. As
effected substances, such as binary compounds and so on, are
engrossed by forms of extension contrary to that of the causal
substances, the forms of extension belonging to the latter, viz.
sphericity and so on, cannot produce similar qualities in the
effects. The world, on the other hand, is not engrossed by any
quality contrary to intelligence owing to which the intelligence
inherent in the cause should not be able to originate a new
intelligence in the effect. For non-intelligence is not a quality
contrary to intelligence, but merely its negation. As thus the case
of sphericity is not an exactly parallel one, intelligence may very
well produce an effect similar to itself.</p>
<p>This argumentation, we rejoin, is not sound. Just as the
qualities of sphericity and so on, although existing in the cause,
do not produce corresponding effects, so it is with <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page384" id="page384"></a>{384}</span>
intelligence also; so that the two cases are parallel so far. Nor
can the circumstance of the effects being engrossed by a different
form of extension be alleged as the reason of sphericity, &amp;c.
not originating qualities similar to themselves; for the power of
originating effects belongs to sphericity, &amp;c. before another
form of extension begins to exist. For it is admitted that the
substance produced remains for a moment devoid of qualities, and
that thereupon only (i.e. after that moment) its qualities begin to
exist. Nor, again, can it be said that sphericity, &amp;c.
concentrate their activity on originating other forms of
extension<a id="footnotetag357" name="footnotetag357"></a><a href=
"#footnote357"><sup>357</sup></a>, and therefore do not originate
forms of extension belonging to the same class as their own; for it
is admitted that the origin of other forms is due to other causes;
as the S&ucirc;tras of Ka<i>n</i>abhuj (Ka<i>n</i>&acirc;da)
themselves declare (Vai<i>s</i>. S&ucirc;t. VII, 1, 9, 'Bigness is
produced from plurality inherent in the causes, from bigness of the
cause and from a kind of accumulation;' VII, 1, 10, 'The contrary
of this (the big) is the minute;' VII, 1, 17, 'Thereby length and
shortness are explained<a id="footnotetag358" name=
"footnotetag358"></a><a href=
"#footnote358"><sup>358</sup></a>').&mdash;Nor, again, can it be
said that plurality, &amp;c. inherent in the cause originate (like
effects) in consequence of some peculiar proximity (in which they
are supposed to stand to the effected substance), while sphericity,
&amp;c. (not standing in a like proximity) do not; for when a new
substance or a new quality is originated, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page385" id="page385"></a>{385}</span> all the
qualities of the cause stand in the same relation of inherence to
their abode (i.e. the causal substance in which they inhere). For
these reasons the fact of sphericity, &amp;c. not originating like
effects can be explained from the essential nature of sphericity,
&amp;c. only, and the same may therefore be maintained with regard
to intelligence<a id="footnotetag359" name=
"footnotetag359"></a><a href="#footnote359"><sup>359</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Moreover, from that observed fact also, that from conjunction
(sa<i>m</i>yoga) there originate substances, &amp;c. belonging to a
class different (from that to which conjunction itself belongs), it
follows that the doctrine of effects belonging to the same class as
the causes from which they spring is too wide. If you remark
against this last argument that, as we have to do at present with a
substance (viz. Brahman), it is inappropriate to instance a quality
(viz. conjunction) as a parallel case; we point out that at present
we only wish to explain the origination of effects belonging to a
different class in general. Nor is there any reason for the
restriction that substances only are to be adduced as examples for
substances, and qualities only for qualities. Your own
S&ucirc;trak&acirc;ra adduces a quality as furnishing a parallel
case for a substance (Vai<i>s</i>. S&ucirc;t. IV, 2, 2, 'On account
of the conjunction of things perceptible and things imperceptible
being imperceptible the body is not composed of five elements').
Just as the conjunction which inheres in the perceptible earth and
the imperceptible ether is not perceptible, the body also, if it
had for its inherent cause the five elements which are part of them
perceptible, part of them imperceptible, would itself be
imperceptible; but, as a matter of fact, it is perceptible; hence
it is not composed of the five elements. Here conjunction is a
quality and the body a substance.&mdash;The origin of effects
different in nature (from the cause) has, moreover, been already
treated of under II, 1; 6.&mdash;Well then, this being so, the
matter has been settled there already (why then is it again
discussed here?)-Because, we reply, there we argued <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page386" id="page386"></a>{386}</span> against
the S&acirc;@nkhya, and at present we have to do with the
Vai<i>s</i>eshika.&mdash;But, already once, before (II, 1, 3) a
line of argument equally applicable to a second case was simply
declared to extend to the latter also; (why then do you not simply
state now that the arguments used to defeat the S&acirc;@nkhya are
equally valid against the Vai<i>s</i>eshika?)&mdash;Because here,
we reply, at the beginning of the examination of the
Vai<i>s</i>eshika system we prefer to discuss the point with
arguments specially adapted to the doctrine of the
Vai<i>s</i>eshikas.</p>
<p>12. In both cases also (in the cases of the
ad<i>ri</i>sh<i>t</i>a inhering either in the atoms or the soul)
action (of the atoms) is not (possible); hence absence of that
(viz. creation and pralaya).</p>
<p>The S&ucirc;trak&acirc;ra now proceeds to refute the doctrine of
atoms being the cause of the world.&mdash;This doctrine arises in
the following manner. We see that all ordinary substances which
consist of parts as, for instance, pieces of cloth originate from
the substances connected with them by the relation of inherence, as
for instance threads, conjunction co-operating (with the parts to
form the whole). We thence draw the general conclusion that
whatever consists of parts has originated from those substances
with which it is connected by the relation of inherence,
conjunction cooperating. That thing now at which the distinction of
whole and parts stops and which marks the limit of division into
minuter parts is the atom.&mdash;This whole world, with its
mountains, oceans, and so on, is composed of parts; because it is
composed of parts it has a beginning and an end<a id=
"footnotetag360" name="footnotetag360"></a><a href=
"#footnote360"><sup>360</sup></a>; an effect may not be assumed
without a cause; therefore the atoms are the cause of the world.
Such is Ka<i>n</i>&acirc;da's doctrine.&mdash;As we observe four
elementary substances consisting of parts, viz. earth, water, fire,
and air (wind), we have to assume four different kinds of atoms.
These atoms marking the limit of subdivision into minuter parts
cannot <span class="pagenum"><a name="page387" id=
"page387"></a>{387}</span> be divided themselves; hence when the
elements are destroyed they can be divided down to atoms only; this
state of atomic division of the elements constitutes the pralaya
(the periodical destruction of the world). After that when the time
for creation comes, motion (karman) springs up in the aerial atoms.
This motion which is due to the unseen principle<a id=
"footnotetag361" name="footnotetag361"></a><a href=
"#footnote361"><sup>361</sup></a> joins the atom in which it
resides to another atom; thus binary compounds, &amp;c. are
produced, and finally the element of air. In a like manner are
produced fire, water, earth, the body with its organs. Thus the
whole world originates from atoms. From the qualities inhering in
the atoms the qualities belonging to the binary compounds are
produced, just as the qualities of the cloth result from the
qualities of the threads.&mdash;Such, in short, is the teaching of
the followers of Ka<i>n</i>&acirc;da.</p>
<p>This doctrine we controvert in the following manner.&mdash;It
must be admitted that the atoms when they are in a state of
isolation require action (motion) to bring about their conjunction;
for we observe that the conjunction of threads and the like is
effected by action. Action again, which is itself an effect,
requires some operative cause by which it is brought about; for
unless some such cause exists, no original motion can take place in
the atoms. If, then, some operative cause is assumed, we may, in
the first place, assume some cause analogous to seen causes, such
as endeavour or impact. But in that case original motion could not
occur at all in the atoms, since causes of that kind are, at the
time, impossible. For in the pralaya state endeavour, which is a
quality of the soul, cannot take place because no body exists then.
For the quality of the soul called endeavour originates when the
soul is connected with the internal organ which abides in the body.
The same reason precludes the assumption of other seen causes such
as impact and the like. For they all are possible only after the
creation of the world has taken place, and cannot therefore be the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page388" id=
"page388"></a>{388}</span> causes of the original action (by which
the world is produced).&mdash;If, in the second place, the unseen
principle is assumed as the cause of the original motion of the
atoms, we ask: Is this unseen principle to be considered as
inhering in the soul or in the atom? In both cases it cannot be the
cause of motion in the atoms, because it is non-intelligent. For,
as we have shown above in our examination of the S&acirc;@nkhya
system, a non-intelligent thing which is not directed by an
intelligent principle cannot of itself either act or be the cause
of action, and the soul cannot be the guiding principle of the
ad<i>ri</i>sh<i>t</i>a because at the time of pralaya its
intelligence has not yet arisen<a id="footnotetag362" name=
"footnotetag362"></a><a href="#footnote362"><sup>362</sup></a>. If,
on the other hand, the unseen principle is supposed to inhere in
the soul, it cannot be the cause of motion in the atoms, because
there exists no connexion of it with the latter. If you say that
the soul in which the unseen principle inheres is connected with
the atoms, then there would result, from the continuity of
connexion<a id="footnotetag363" name="footnotetag363"></a><a href=
"#footnote363"><sup>363</sup></a>, continuity of action, as there
is no other restricting principle.&mdash;Hence, there being no
definite cause of action, original action cannot take place in the
atoms; there being no action, conjunction of the atoms which
depends on action cannot take place; there being no conjunction,
all the effects depending on it, viz. the formation of binary
atomic compounds, &amp;c., cannot originate.</p>
<p>How, moreover, is the conjunction of one atom with another to be
imagined? Is it to be total interpenetration of the two or partial
conjunction? If the former, then no increase of bulk could take
place, and consequently atomic size only would exist; moreover, it
would be contrary to what is observed, as we see that conjunction
takes place between substances having parts (prade<i>s</i>a). If
the latter, it would follow that the atoms are composed of
parts.&mdash;Let then the atoms be imagined to consist of
parts.&mdash;If so, imagined things being unreal, the conjunction
also of the atoms would be unreal and thus could not be the
non-inherent <span class="pagenum"><a name="page389" id=
"page389"></a>{389}</span> cause of real things. And without
non-inherent causes effected substances such as binary compounds,
&amp;c. could not originate. And just as at the time of the first
creation motion of the atoms leading to their conjunction could not
take place, there being no cause of such motion; thus at the time
of a general pralaya also no action could take place leading to
their separation, since for that occurrence also no definite seen
cause could be alleged. Nor could the unseen principle be adduced
as the cause, since its purport is to effect enjoyment (of reward
and punishment on the part of the soul), not to bring about the
pralaya. There being then no possibility of action to effect either
the conjunction or the separation of the atoms, neither conjunction
nor separation would actually take place, and hence neither
creation nor pralaya of the world.&mdash;For these reasons the
doctrine of the atoms being the cause of the world must be
rejected.</p>
<p>13. And because in consequence of samav&acirc;ya being admitted
a regressus in infinitum results from parity of reasoning.</p>
<p>You (the Vai<i>s</i>eshika) admit that a binary compound which
originates from two atoms, while absolutely different from them, is
connected with them by the relation of inherence; but on that
assumption the doctrine of the atoms being the general cause cannot
be established, 'because parity involves here a retrogressus ad
infinitum.' For just as a binary compound which is absolutely
different from the two constituent atoms is connected with them by
means of the relation of inherence (samav&acirc;ya), so the
relation of inherence itself being absolutely different from the
two things which it connects, requires another relation of
inherence to connect it with them, there being absolute difference
in both cases. For this second relation of inherence again, a third
relation of inherence would have to be assumed and so on ad
infinitum.&mdash;But&mdash;the Vai<i>s</i>eshika is supposed to
reply&mdash;we are conscious of the so-called samav&acirc;ya
relation as eternally connected with the things between which it
exists, not as <span class="pagenum"><a name="page390" id=
"page390"></a>{390}</span> either non-connected with them or as
depending on another connexion; we are therefore not obliged to
assume another connexion, and again another, and so on, and thus to
allow ourselves to be driven into a regressus in
infinitum.&mdash;Your defence is unavailing, we reply, for it would
involve the admission that conjunction (sa<i>m</i>yoga) also as
being eternally connected with the things which it joins does, like
samav&acirc;ya, not require another connexion<a id="footnotetag364"
name="footnotetag364"></a><a href=
"#footnote364"><sup>364</sup></a>. If you say that conjunction does
require another connexion because it is a different thing<a id=
"footnotetag365" name="footnotetag365"></a><a href=
"#footnote365"><sup>365</sup></a> we reply that then samav&acirc;ya
also requires another connexion because it is likewise a different
thing. Nor can you say that conjunction does require another
connexion because it is a quality (gu<i>n</i>a), and samav&acirc;ya
does not because it is not a quality; for (in spite of this
difference) the reason for another connexion being required is the
same in both cases<a id="footnotetag366" name=
"footnotetag366"></a><a href="#footnote366"><sup>366</sup></a>, and
not that which is technically called 'quality' is the cause (of
another connexion being required)<a id="footnotetag367" name=
"footnotetag367"></a><a href=
"#footnote367"><sup>367</sup></a>.&mdash;For these reasons those
who acknowledge samav&acirc;ya to be a separate existence are
driven into a regressus in infinitum, in consequence of which, the
impossibility of one term involving the impossibility of the entire
series, not even the origination of a binary compound from two
atoms can be accounted for.&mdash;For this reason also the atomic
doctrine is inadmissible.</p>
<p>14. And on account of the permanent existence (of activity or
non-activity).</p>
<p>Moreover, the atoms would have to be assumed as either
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page391" id=
"page391"></a>{391}</span> essentially active (moving) or
essentially non-active, or both or neither; there being no fifth
alternative. But none of the four alternatives stated is possible.
If they were essentially active, their activity would be permanent
so that no pralaya could take place. If they were essentially
non-active, their non-activity would be permanent, and no creation
could take place. Their being both is impossible because
self-contradictory. If they were neither, their activity and
non-activity would have to depend on an operative cause, and then
the operative causes such as the ad<i>ri</i>sh<i>t</i>a being in
permanent proximity to the atoms, permanent activity would result;
or else the ad<i>ri</i>sh<i>t</i>a and so on not being taken as
operative causes, the consequence would be permanent non-activity
on the part of the atoms.&mdash;For this reason also the atomic
doctrine is untenable.</p>
<p>15. And on account of the atoms having colour, &amp;c., the
reverse (of the Vai<i>s</i>eshika tenet would take place); as thus
it is observed.</p>
<p>Let us suppose, the Vai<i>s</i>eshikas say, all substances
composed of parts to be disintegrated into their parts; a limit
will finally be reached beyond which the process of disintegration
cannot be continued. What constitutes that limit are the atoms,
which are eternal (permanent), belong to four different classes,
possess the qualities of colour, &amp;c., and are the originating
principles of this whole material world with its colour, form, and
other qualities.</p>
<p>This fundamental assumption of the Vai<i>s</i>eshikas we declare
to be groundless because from the circumstance of the atoms having
colour and other qualities there would follow the contrary of
atomic minuteness and permanency, i.e. it would follow that,
compared to the ultimate cause, they are gross and non-permanent.
For ordinary experience teaches that whatever things possess colour
and other qualities are, compared to their cause, gross and
non-permanent. A piece of cloth, for instance, is gross compared to
the threads of which it consists, and non permanent; and the
threads again are non-permanent and gross compared <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page392" id="page392"></a>{392}</span> to the
filaments of which they are made up. Therefore the atoms also which
the Vai<i>s</i>eshikas admit to have colour, &amp;c. must have
causes compared to which they are gross and non-permanent. Hence
that reason also which Ka<i>n</i>&acirc;da gives for the permanence
of the atoms (IV, 1, 1, 'that which exists without having a cause
is permanent') does not apply at all to the atoms because, as we
have shown just now, the atoms are to be considered as having a
cause.&mdash;The second reason also which Ka<i>n</i>&acirc;da
brings forward for the permanency of the atoms, viz. in IV, 1, 4,
'the special negation implied in the term non-eternal would not be
possible<a id="footnotetag368" name="footnotetag368"></a><a href=
"#footnote368"><sup>368</sup></a>' (if there did not exist
something eternal, viz. the atoms), does not necessarily prove the
permanency of the atoms; for supposing that there exists not any
permanent thing, the formation of a negative compound such as
'non-eternal' is impossible. Nor does the existence of the word
'non-permanent' absolutely presuppose the permanency of atoms; for
there exists (as we Ved&acirc;ntins maintain) another permanent
ultimate Cause, viz. Brahman. Nor can the existence of anything be
established merely on the ground of a word commonly being used in
that sense, since there is room for common use only if word and
matter are well-established by some other means of right
knowledge.&mdash;The third reason also given in the Vai<i>s</i>.
S&ucirc;tras (IV, 1, 5) for the permanency of the atoms ('and
Nescience') is unavailing. For if we explain that S&ucirc;tra to
mean 'the non-perception of those actually existing causes whose
effects are seen is Nescience,' it would follow that the binary
atomic compounds also are permanent<a id="footnotetag369" name=
"footnotetag369"></a><a href="#footnote369"><sup>369</sup></a>. And
if we tried to escape from that difficulty by including (in the
explanation of the S&ucirc;tra as given above) the qualification
'there being absence of (originating) substances,' <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page393" id="page393"></a>{393}</span> then
nothing else but the absence of a cause would furnish the reason
for the permanency of the atoms, and as that reason had already
been mentioned before (in IV, 1, 1) the S&ucirc;tra IV, 1, 5 would
be a useless restatement.&mdash;Well, then (the Vai<i>s</i>eshika
might say), let us understand by 'Nescience' (in the S&ucirc;tra)
the impossibility of conceiving a third reason of the destruction
(of effects), in addition to the division of the causal substance
into its parts, and the destruction of the causal substance; which
impossibility involves the permanency of the atoms<a id=
"footnotetag370" name="footnotetag370"></a><a href=
"#footnote370"><sup>370</sup></a>.&mdash;There is no necessity, we
reply, for assuming that a thing when perishing must perish on
account of either of those two reasons. That assumption would
indeed have to be made if it were generally admitted that a new
substance is produced only by the conjunction of several causal
substances. But if it is admitted that a causal substance may
originate a new substance by passing over into a qualified state
after having previously existed free from qualifications, in its
pure generality, it follows that the effected substance may be
destroyed by its solidity being dissolved, just as the hardness of
ghee is dissolved by the action of fire<a id="footnotetag371" name=
"footnotetag371"></a><a href=
"#footnote371"><sup>371</sup></a>.&mdash;Thus there would result,
from the circumstance of the atoms having colour, &amp;c., the
opposite of what the Vai<i>s</i>eshikas mean. For this reason also
the atomic doctrine cannot be maintained.</p>
<p>16. And as there are difficulties in both cases.</p>
<p>Earth has the qualities of smell, taste, colour, and touch, and
is gross; water has colour, taste, and touch, and is fine; fire has
colour and touch, and is finer yet; air is finest of all, and has
the quality of touch only. The question now arises whether the
atoms constituting the four elements are to be assumed to possess
the same greater or smaller <span class="pagenum"><a name="page394"
id="page394"></a>{394}</span> number of qualities as the respective
elements.&mdash;Either assumption leads to unacceptable
consequences. For if we assume that some kinds of atoms have more
numerous qualities, it follows that their solid size (m&ucirc;rti)
will be increased thereby, and that implies their being atoms no
longer. That an increase of qualities cannot take place without a
simultaneous increase of size we infer from our observations
concerning effected material bodies.&mdash;If, on the other hand,
we assume, in order to save the equality of atoms of all kinds,
that there is no difference in the number of their qualities, we
must either suppose that they have all one quality only; but in
that case we should not perceive touch in fire nor colour and touch
in water, nor taste, colour, and touch in earth, since the
qualities of the effects have for their antecedents the qualities
of the causes. Or else we must suppose all atoms to have all the
four qualities; but in that case we should necessarily perceive
what we actually do not perceive, viz. smell in water, smell and
taste in fire, smell, taste, and colour in air.&mdash;Hence on this
account also the atomic doctrine shows itself to be
unacceptable.</p>
<p>17. And as the (atomic theory) is not accepted (by any
authoritative persons) it is to be disregarded altogether.</p>
<p>While the theory of the pradh&acirc;na being the cause of the
world has been accepted by some adherents of the Veda&mdash;as, for
instance, Manu&mdash;with a view to the doctrines of the effect
existing in the cause already, and so on, the atomic doctrine has
not been accepted by any persons of authority in any of its parts,
and therefore is to be disregarded entirely by all those who take
their stand on the Veda.</p>
<p>There are, moreover, other objections to the Vai<i>s</i>eshika
doctrine.&mdash;The Vai<i>s</i>eshikas assume six categories, which
constitute the subject-matter of their system, viz. substance,
quality, action, generality, particularity, and inherence. These
six categories they maintain to be absolutely different from each
other, and to have different characteristics; <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page395" id="page395"></a>{395}</span> just as a
man, a horse, a hare differ from one another. Side by side with
this assumption they make another which contradicts the former one,
viz. that quality, action, &amp;c. have the attribute of depending
on substance. But that is altogether inappropriate; for just as
ordinary things, such as animals, grass, trees, and the like, being
absolutely different from each other do not depend on each other,
so the qualities, &amp;c. also being absolutely different from
substance, cannot depend on the latter. Or else let the qualities,
&amp;c. depend on substance; then it follows that, as they are
present where substance is present, and absent where it is absent,
substance only exists, and, according to its various forms, becomes
the object of different terms and conceptions (such as quality,
action, &amp;c.); just as Devadatta, for instance, according to the
conditions in which he finds himself is the object of various
conceptions and names. But this latter alternative would involve
the acceptation of the S&acirc;@nkhya doctrine<a id=
"footnotetag372" name="footnotetag372"></a><a href=
"#footnote372"><sup>372</sup></a> and the abandonment of the
Vai<i>s</i>eshika standpoint.&mdash;But (the Vai<i>s</i>eshika may
say) smoke also is different from fire and yet it is dependent on
it.&mdash;True, we reply; but we ascertain the difference of smoke
and fire from the fact of their being apperceived in separation.
Substance and quality, on the other hand, are not so apperceived;
for when we are conscious of a white blanket, or a red cow, or a
blue lotus, the substance is in each case cognised by means of the
quality; the latter therefore has its Self in the substance. The
same reasoning applies to action, generality, particularity, and
inherence.</p>
<p>If you (the Vai<i>s</i>eshika) say that qualities, actions,
&amp;c. (although not non-different from substances) may yet depend
on the latter because substances and qualities stand in the
relation of one not being able to exist without the other
(ayutasiddhi<a id="footnotetag373" name=
"footnotetag373"></a><a href="#footnote373"><sup>373</sup></a>); we
point out that things which are <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page396" id="page396"></a>{396}</span> ayutasiddha must either be
non-separate in place, or non-separate in time, or non-separate in
nature, and that none of these alternatives agrees with
Vai<i>s</i>eshika principles. For the first alternative contradicts
your own assumptions according to which the cloth originating from
the threads occupies the place of the threads only, not that of the
cloth, while the qualities of the cloth, such as its white colour,
occupy the place of the cloth only, not that of the threads. So the
Vai<i>s</i>eshika-s&ucirc;tras say (I, 1, 10), 'Substances
originate another substance and qualities another quality.' The
threads which constitute the causal substance originate the
effected substance, viz. the cloth, and the qualities of the
threads, such as white colour, &amp;c., produce in the cloth new
corresponding qualities. But this doctrine is clearly contradicted
by the assumption of substance and quality being non-separate in
place.&mdash;If, in the second place, you explain ayutasiddhatva as
non-separation in time, it follows also that, for instance, the
right and the left horn of a cow would be ayutasiddha.&mdash;And
if, finally, you explain it to mean 'non-separation in character,'
it is impossible to make any further distinction between the
substance and the quality, as then quality is conceived as being
identical with substance.</p>
<p>Moreover, the distinction which the Vai<i>s</i>eshikas make
between conjunction (sa<i>m</i>yoga) as being the connexion of
things which can exist separately, and inherence (samav&acirc;ya)
as being the connexion of things which are incapable of separate
existence is futile, since the cause which exists before the
effect<a id="footnotetag374" name="footnotetag374"></a><a href=
"#footnote374"><sup>374</sup></a> cannot be said to be incapable of
separate existence. Perhaps the Vai<i>s</i>eshika will say that his
definition refers to one of the two terms only, so that
samav&acirc;ya is the connexion, with the cause, of the effect
which is incapable of separate existence. But this also is of no
avail; for as a connexion requires two terms, the effect as long as
it has not yet entered into being cannot be connected with the
cause. And it would be equally unavailing to say that the effect
enters into the connexion after it has begun to exist; for if the
Vai<i>s</i>eshika admits that the effect <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page397" id="page397"></a>{397}</span> may exist
previous to its connexion with the cause, it is no longer
ayutasiddha (incapable of separate existence), and thereby the
principle that between effect and cause conjunction and disjunction
do not take place is violated.<a id="footnotetag375" name=
"footnotetag375"></a><a href="#footnote375"><sup>375</sup></a>
And<a id="footnotetag376" name="footnotetag376"></a><a href=
"#footnote376"><sup>376</sup></a> just as conjunction, and not
samav&acirc;ya, is the connexion in which every effected substance
as soon as it has been produced stands with the all-pervading
substances as ether, &amp;c.&mdash;although no motion has taken
place on the part of the effected substance&mdash;so also the
connexion of the effect with the cause will be conjunction merely,
not samav&acirc;ya.</p>
<p>Nor is there any proof for the existence of any connexion,
samav&acirc;ya or sa<i>m</i>yoga, apart from the things which it
connects. If it should be maintained that sa<i>m</i>yoga and
samav&acirc;ya have such an existence because we observe that there
are names and ideas of them in addition to the names and ideas of
the things connected, we point out that one and the same thing may
be the subject of several names and ideas if it is considered in
its relations to what lies without it. Devadatta although being one
only forms the object of many different names and notions according
as he is considered in himself or in his relations to others; thus
he is thought and spoken of as man, br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a learned
in the Veda, generous, boy, young man, father, grandson, brother,
son-in-law, &amp;c. So, again, one and the same stroke is,
according to the place it is connected with, spoken of and
conceived as meaning either ten, or hundred, or thousand, &amp;c.
Analogously, two connected things are not only conceived and
denoted as connected things, but in addition constitute the object
of the ideas and terms 'conjunction' or 'inherence' which however
do not prove <span class="pagenum"><a name="page398" id=
"page398"></a>{398}</span> themselves to be separate
entities.&mdash;Things standing thus, the non-existence of separate
entities (conjunction, &amp;c.), which entities would have to be
established on the ground of perception, follows from the fact of
their non-perception.&mdash;Nor, again<a id="footnotetag377" name=
"footnotetag377"></a><a href="#footnote377"><sup>377</sup></a>,
does the circumstance of the word and idea of connexion having for
its object the things connected involve the connexion's permanent
existence, since we have already shown above that one thing may, on
account of its relations to other things, be conceived and denoted
in different ways.</p>
<p>Further<a id="footnotetag378" name="footnotetag378"></a><a href=
"#footnote378"><sup>378</sup></a>, conjunction cannot take place
between the atoms, the soul, and the internal organ, because they
have no parts; for we observe that conjunction takes place only of
such substances as consist of parts. If the Vai<i>s</i>eshika
should say that parts of the atoms, soul and mind may be assumed
(in order to explain their alleged conjunction), we remark that the
assumption of actually non-existing things would involve the result
that anything might be established; for there is no restrictive
rule that only such and such non-existing things&mdash;whether
contradictory to reason or not&mdash;should be assumed and not any
other, and assumptions depend on one's choice only and may be
carried to any extent. If we once allow assumptions, there is no
reason why there should not be assumed a further hundred or
thousand things, in addition to the six categories assumed by the
Vai<i>s</i>eshikas. Anybody might then assume anything, and we
could neither stop a compassionate man from assuming that this
transmigratory world which is the cause of so much misery to living
beings is not to be, nor a malicious man from assuming that even
the released souls are to enter on a new cycle of existences.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page399" id=
"page399"></a>{399}</span>
<p>Further, it is not possible that a binary atomic compound, which
consists of parts, should be connected with the simple indivisible
atoms by an intimate connexion (sa<i>ms</i>lesha) any more than
they can thus be connected with ether; for between ether and earth,
&amp;c. there does not exist that kind of intimate connexion which
exists, for instance, between wood and varnish<a id=
"footnotetag379" name="footnotetag379"></a><a href=
"#footnote379"><sup>379</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Let it then be said (the Vai<i>s</i>eshika resumes) that the
samav&acirc;ya relation must be assumed, because otherwise the
relation of that which abides and that which forms the
abode&mdash;which relation actually exists between the effected
substance and the causal substance&mdash;is not
possible.&mdash;That would, we reply, involve the vice of mutual
dependence; for only when the separateness of cause and effect is
established, the relation of the abode and that which abides can be
established; and only when the latter relation is established, the
relation of separateness can be established. For the
Ved&acirc;ntins acknowledge neither the separateness of cause and
effect, nor their standing to each other in the relation of abode
and thing abiding, since according to their doctrine the effect is
only a certain state of the cause<a id="footnotetag380" name=
"footnotetag380"></a><a href=
"#footnote380"><sup>380</sup></a>.&mdash;Moreover, as the atoms are
limited (not of infinite extension), they must in reality consist
of as many parts as we acknowledge regions of space<a id=
"footnotetag381" name="footnotetag381"></a><a href=
"#footnote381"><sup>381</sup></a>, whether those be six or eight or
ten, and consequently they cannot be permanent; conclusions
contrary to the Vai<i>s</i>eshika doctrine of the indivisibility
and permanency of the atoms.&mdash;If the Vai<i>s</i>eshika replies
that those very parts which are owing to the existence of the
different regions of space are his (indestructible) <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page400" id="page400"></a>{400}</span> atoms; we
deny that because all things whatever, forming a series of
substances of ever-increasing minuteness, are capable of
dissolution, until the highest cause (Brahman) is reached.
Earth&mdash;which is, in comparison with a binary compound, the
grossest thing of all&mdash;undergoes decomposition; so do the
substances following next which belong to the same class as earth;
so does the binary compound; and so does, finally, the atom which
(although the minutest thing of all) still belongs to the same
general class (i.e. matter) with earth, &amp;c. The objection
(which the Vai<i>s</i>eshika might possibly raise here again) that
things can be decomposed only by the separation of their
parts<a id="footnotetag382" name="footnotetag382"></a><a href=
"#footnote382"><sup>382</sup></a>, we have already disposed of
above, where we pointed out that decomposition may take place in a
manner analogous to the melting of ghee. Just as the hardness of
ghee, gold, and the like, is destroyed in consequence of those
substances being rendered liquid by their contact with fire, no
separation of the parts taking place all the while; so the solid
shape of the atoms also may be decomposed by their passing back
into the indifferenced condition of the highest cause. In the same
way the origination of effects also is brought about not merely in
the way of conjunction of parts; for we see that milk, for
instance, and water originate effects such as sour milk and ice
without there taking place any conjunction of parts.</p>
<p>It thus appears that the atomic doctrine is supported by very
weak arguments only, is opposed to those scriptural passages which
declare the Lord to be the general cause, and is not accepted by
any of the authorities taking their stand on Scripture, such as
Manu and others. Hence it is to be altogether disregarded by
highminded men who have a regard for their own spiritual
welfare.</p>
<p>18. (If there be assumed) the (dyad of) aggregates with its two
causes, (there takes place) non-establishment of those (two
aggregates).</p>
<p>The reasons on account of which the doctrine of the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page401" id="page401"></a>{401}</span>
Vai<i>s</i>eshikas cannot be accepted have been stated above. That
doctrine may be called semi-destructive (or semi-nihilistic<a id=
"footnotetag383" name="footnotetag383"></a><a href=
"#footnote383"><sup>383</sup></a>). That the more thorough doctrine
which teaches universal non-permanency is even less worthy of being
taken into consideration, we now proceed to show.</p>
<p>That doctrine is presented in a variety of forms, due either to
the difference of the views (maintained by Buddha at different
times), or else to the difference of capacity on the part of the
disciples (of Buddha). Three principal opinions may, however, be
distinguished; the opinion of those who maintain the reality of
everything (Realists, sarv&acirc;stitvav&acirc;din); the opinion of
those who maintain that thought only is real (Idealists,
vij<i>&ntilde;</i>&agrave;nav&acirc;din); and the opinion of those
who maintain that everything is void (unreal; Nihilists,
<i>s</i>&ucirc;nyav&acirc;din<a id="footnotetag384" name=
"footnotetag384"></a><a href=
"#footnote384"><sup>384</sup></a>).&mdash;We first controvert those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page402" id=
"page402"></a>{402}</span> who maintain that everything, external
as well as internal, is real. What is external is either element
(bh&ucirc;ta) or elementary (bhautika); what is internal is either
mind (<i>k</i>itta) or mental (<i>k</i>aitta). The elements are
earth, water, and so on; elemental are colour, &amp;c. on the one
hand, and the eye and the other sense-organs on the other hand.
Earth and the other three elements arise from the aggregation of
the four different kinds of atoms; the atoms of earth being hard,
those of water viscid, those of fire hot, those of air
mobile.:&mdash;The inward world consists of the five so-called
'groups' (skandha), the group of sensation (r&ucirc;paskandha), the
group of knowledge (vij<i>&ntilde;</i>&acirc;naskandha), the group
of feeling (vedan&acirc;skandha), the group of verbal knowledge
(samj<i>&ntilde;</i>&acirc;skandha), and the group of impressions
(sa<i>m</i>sk&acirc;raskandha)<a id="footnotetag385" name=
"footnotetag385"></a><a href="#footnote385"><sup>385</sup></a>;
which <span class="pagenum"><a name="page403" id=
"page403"></a>{403}</span> taken together constitute the basis of
all personal existence<a id="footnotetag386" name=
"footnotetag386"></a><a href="#footnote386"><sup>386</sup></a>.</p>
<p>With reference to this doctrine we make the following
remarks.&mdash;Those two aggregates, constituting two different
classes, and having two different causes which the Bauddhas assume,
viz. the aggregate of the elements and elementary things whose
cause the atoms are, and the aggregate of the five skandhas whose
cause the skandhas are, cannot, on Bauddha principles, be
established, i.e. it cannot be explained how the aggregates are
brought about. For the parts constituting the (material) aggregates
are devoid of intelligence, and the kindling (abhijvalana) of
intelligence depends on an aggregate of atoms having been brought
about previously<a id="footnotetag387" name=
"footnotetag387"></a><a href="#footnote387"><sup>387</sup></a>. And
the Bauddhas do not admit any other permanent intelligent being,
such as either an enjoying soul or a ruling Lord, which could
effect the aggregation of the atoms. Nor can the atoms and skandhas
be assumed to enter on activity on their own account; for that
would imply their never ceasing to be active<a id="footnotetag388"
name="footnotetag388"></a><a href=
"#footnote388"><sup>388</sup></a>. Nor can the cause of aggregation
be looked for in the so-called abode (i.e. the
&acirc;layavij<i>&ntilde;</i>&acirc;na-prav&acirc;ha, the train of
self-cognitions); for the latter must be described either as
different from the single cognitions or as not different from them.
(In the former case it is either permanent, and then it is nothing
else but the permanent soul of the Ved&acirc;ntins; or
non-permanent;) then being admitted to be momentary merely, it
cannot exercise any influence and cannot therefore be the cause of
the motion of the atoms<a id="footnotetag389" name=
"footnotetag389"></a><a href="#footnote389"><sup>389</sup></a>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page404" id=
"page404"></a>{404}</span> (And in the latter case we are not
further advanced than before.)&mdash;For all these reasons the
formation of aggregates cannot be accounted for. But without
aggregates there would be an end of the stream of mundane existence
which presupposes those aggregates.</p>
<p>19. If it be said that (the formation of aggregates may be
explained) through (Nescience, &amp;c.) standing in the relation of
mutual causality; we say 'No,' because they merely are the
efficient causes of the origin (of the immediately subsequent
links).</p>
<p>Although there exists no permanent intelligent principle of the
nature either of a ruling Lord or an enjoying soul, under whose
influence the formation of aggregates could take place, yet the
course of mundane existence is rendered possible through the mutual
causality<a id="footnotetag390" name="footnotetag390"></a><a href=
"#footnote390"><sup>390</sup></a> of Nescience and so on, so that
we need not look for any other combining principle.</p>
<p>The series beginning with Nescience comprises the following
members: Nescience, impression, knowledge, name and form, the abode
of the six, touch, feeling, desire, activity, birth, species,
decay, death, grief, lamentation, pain, mental affliction, and the
like<a id="footnotetag391" name="footnotetag391"></a><a href=
"#footnote391"><sup>391</sup></a>. All these terms constitute
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page405" id=
"page405"></a>{405}</span> a chain of causes and are as such spoken
of in the Bauddha system, sometimes cursorily, sometimes at length.
They are, moreover, all acknowledged as existing, not by the
Bauddhas only, but by the followers of all systems. And as the
cycles of Nescience, &amp;c. forming uninterrupted chains of causes
and effects revolve unceasingly like water-wheels, the existence of
the aggregates (which constitute bodies and minds) must needs be
assumed, as without such Nescience and so on could not take
place.</p>
<p>This argumentation of the Bauddha we are unable to accept,
because it merely assigns efficient causes for the origination of
the members of the series, but does not intimate an efficient cause
for the formation of the aggregates. If the Bauddha reminds us of
the statement made above that the existence of aggregates must
needs be inferred from the existence of Nescience and so on, we
point out that, if he means thereby that Nescience and so on cannot
exist without aggregates and hence require the existence of such,
it remains to assign an efficient cause for the formation of the
aggregates. But, as we have already shown&mdash;when examining the
Vaijeshika doctrine&mdash;that the formation of aggregates cannot
be accounted for even on the assumption of permanent atoms and
individual souls in <span class="pagenum"><a name="page406" id=
"page406"></a>{406}</span> which the ad<i>ri</i>sh<i>t</i>a
abides<a id="footnotetag392" name="footnotetag392"></a><a href=
"#footnote392"><sup>392</sup></a>; how much less then are
aggregates possible if there exist only momentary atoms not
connected with enjoying souls and devoid of abodes (i.e. souls),
and that which abides in them (the
ad<i>ri</i>sh<i>t</i>a).&mdash;Let us then assume (the Bauddha
says) that Nescience, &amp;c. themselves are the efficient cause of
the aggregate.&mdash;But how&mdash;we ask&mdash;can they be the
cause of that without which&mdash;as their abode&mdash;they
themselves are not capable of existence? Perhaps you will say that
in the eternal sa<i>m</i>s&acirc;ra the aggregates succeed one
another in an unbroken chain, and hence also Nescience, and so on,
which abide in those aggregates. But in that case you will have to
assume either that each aggregate necessarily produces another
aggregate of the same kind, or that, without any settled rule, it
may produce either a like or an unlike one. In the former case a
human body could never pass over into that of a god or an animal or
a being of the infernal regions; in the latter case a man might in
an instant be turned into an elephant or a god and again become a
man; either of which consequences would be contrary to your
system.&mdash;Moreover, that for the purpose of whose enjoyment the
aggregate is formed is, according to your doctrine, not a permanent
enjoying soul, so that enjoyment subserves itself merely and cannot
be desired by anything else; hence final release also must,
according to you, be considered as subserving itself <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page407" id="page407"></a>{407}</span> only, and
no being desirous of release can be assumed. If a being desirous of
both were assumed, it would have to be conceived as permanently
existing up to the time of enjoyment and release, and that would be
contrary to your doctrine of general impermanency.&mdash;There may
therefore exist a causal relation between the members of the series
consisting of Nescience, &amp;c., but, in the absence of a
permanent enjoying soul, it is impossible to establish on that
ground the existence of aggregates.</p>
<p>20. (Nor can there be a causal relation between Nescience,
&amp;c.), because on the origination of the subsequent (moment) the
preceding one ceases to be.</p>
<p>We have hitherto argued that Nescience, and so on, stand in a
causal relation to each other merely, so that they cannot be made
to account for the existence of aggregates; we are now going to
prove that they cannot even be considered as efficient causes of
the subsequent members of the series to which they belong.</p>
<p>Those who maintain that everything has a momentary existence
only admit that when the thing existing in the second moment<a id=
"footnotetag393" name="footnotetag393"></a><a href=
"#footnote393"><sup>393</sup></a> enters into being the thing
existing in the first moment ceases to be. On this admission it is
impossible to establish between the two things the relation of
cause and effect, since the former momentary existence which ceases
or has ceased to be, and so has entered into the state of
non-existence, cannot be the cause of the later momentary
existence.&mdash;Let it then be said that the former momentary
existence when it has reached its full development becomes the
cause of the later momentary existence.&mdash;That also is
impossible; for the assumption that a fully developed existence
exerts a further energy, involves the conclusion that it is
connected with a second moment (which contradicts the doctrine of
universal momentariness).&mdash;Then let the mere existence of the
antecedent entity constitute its <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page408" id="page408"></a>{408}</span> causal energy.&mdash;That
assumption also is fruitless, because we cannot conceive the
origination of an effect which is not imbued with the nature of the
cause (i.e. in which the nature of the cause does not continue to
exist). And to assume that the nature of the cause does continue to
exist in the effect is impossible (on the Bauddha doctrine), as
that would involve the permanency of the cause, and thus
necessitate the abandonment of the doctrine of general
non-permanency.&mdash;Nor can it be admitted that the relation of
cause and effect holds good without the cause somehow giving its
colouring to the effect; for that doctrine might unduly be extended
to all cases<a id="footnotetag394" name=
"footnotetag394"></a><a href=
"#footnote394"><sup>394</sup></a>.&mdash;Moreover, the origination
and cessation of things of which the Bauddha speaks must either
constitute a thing's own form or another state of it, or an
altogether different thing. But none of these alternatives agrees
with the general Bauddha principles. If, in the first place,
origination and cessation constituted the form of a thing, it would
follow that the word 'thing' and the words 'origination' and
'cessation' are interchangeable (which is not the case).&mdash;Let
then, secondly, the Bauddha says, a certain difference be assumed,
in consequence of which the terms 'origination' and 'cessation' may
denote the initial and final states of that which in the
intermediate state is called thing.&mdash;In that case, we reply,
the thing will be connected with three moments, viz. the initial,
the intermediate, and the final one, so that the doctrine of
general momentariness will have to be abandoned.&mdash;Let then, as
the third alternative, origination and cessation be altogether
different from the thing, as much as a buffalo is from a
horse.&mdash;That too cannot be, we reply; for it would lead to the
conclusion that the thing, because altogether disconnected with
origination and cessation, is everlasting. And the same conclusion
would be led up to, if we understood by the origination and
cessation of a thing merely its perception and non-perception; for
the latter are attributes of the percipient mind only, not of the
thing itself.&mdash;Hence <span class="pagenum"><a name="page409"
id="page409"></a>{409}</span> we have again to declare the Bauddha
doctrine to be untenable.</p>
<p>21. On the supposition of there being no (cause: while yet the
effect takes place), there results contradiction of the admitted
principle; otherwise simultaneousness (of cause and effect).</p>
<p>It has been shown that on the doctrine of general
non-permanency, the former momentary existence, as having already
been merged in non-existence, cannot be the cause of the later
one.&mdash;Perhaps now the Bauddha will say that an effect may
arise even when there is no cause.&mdash;That, we reply, implies
the abandonment of a principle admitted by yourself, viz. that the
mind and the mental modifications originate when in conjunction
with four kinds of causes<a id="footnotetag395" name=
"footnotetag395"></a><a href="#footnote395"><sup>395</sup></a>.
Moreover, if anything could originate without a cause, there would
be nothing to prevent that anything might originate at any
time.&mdash;If, on the other hand, you should say that we may
assume the antecedent momentary existence to last until the
succeeding one has been produced, we point out that that would
imply the simultaneousness of cause and effect, and so run counter
to an accepted Bauddha tenet, viz. that all things<a id=
"footnotetag396" name="footnotetag396"></a><a href=
"#footnote396"><sup>396</sup></a> are momentary merely.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page410" id=
"page410"></a>{410}</span>
<p>22. Cessation dependent on a sublative act of the mind, and
cessation not so dependent cannot be established, there being no
(complete) interruption.</p>
<p>The Bauddhas who maintain that universal destruction is going on
constantly, assume that 'whatever forms an object of knowledge and
is different from the triad is produced (sa<i>m</i>sk<i>ri</i>ta)
and momentary.' To the triad there mentioned they give the names
'cessation dependent on a sublative act of the mind,' 'cessation
not dependent on such an act,' and 'space.' This triad they hold to
be non-substantial, of a merely negative character
(abh&acirc;vam&acirc;tra), devoid of all positive characteristics.
By 'cessation dependent on a sublative act of the mind,' we have to
understand such destruction of entities as is preceded by an act of
thought<a id="footnotetag397" name="footnotetag397"></a><a href=
"#footnote397"><sup>397</sup></a>; by 'cessation not so dependent'
is meant destruction of the opposite kind<a id="footnotetag398"
name="footnotetag398"></a><a href=
"#footnote398"><sup>398</sup></a>; by 'space' is meant absence in
general of something covering (or occupying space). Out of these
three non-existences 'space' will be refuted later on (S&ucirc;tra
24), the two other ones are refuted in the present S&ucirc;tra.</p>
<p>Cessation which is dependent on a sublative act of the mind, and
cessation which is not so dependent are both impossible, 'on
account of the absence of interruption.' For both kinds of
cessation must have reference either to the series (of momentary
existences) or to the single members constituting the
series.&mdash;The former alternative is impossible, because in all
series (of momentary existences) the members of the series stand in
an unbroken relation of cause and effect so that the series cannot
be interrupted<a id="footnotetag399" name=
"footnotetag399"></a><a href=
"#footnote399"><sup>399</sup></a>.&mdash;The latter <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page411" id="page411"></a>{411}</span>
alternative is likewise inadmissible, for it is impossible to
maintain that any momentary existence should undergo complete
annihilation entirely undefinable and disconnected (with the
previous state of existence), since we observe that a thing is
recognised in the various states through which it may pass and thus
has a connected existence<a id="footnotetag400" name=
"footnotetag400"></a><a href="#footnote400"><sup>400</sup></a>. And
in those cases also where a thing is not clearly recognised (after
having undergone a change) we yet infer, on the ground of actual
observations made in other cases, that one and the same thing
continues to exist without any interruption.&mdash;For these
reasons the two kinds of cessation which the Bauddhas assume cannot
be proved.</p>
<p>23. And on account of the objections presenting themselves in
either case.</p>
<p>The cessation of Nescience, &amp;c. which, on the assumption of
the Bauddhas, is included in the two kinds of cessation discussed
hitherto, must take place either in consequence of perfect
knowledge together with its auxiliaries, or else of its own accord.
But the former alternative would imply the abandonment of the
Bauddha doctrine that destruction takes place without a cause, and
the latter alternative would involve the uselessness of the Bauddha
instruction as to the 'path'<a id="footnotetag401" name=
"footnotetag401"></a><a href="#footnote401"><sup>401</sup></a>. As
therefore both alternatives are open to objections, the Bauddha
doctrine must be declared unsatisfactory.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page412" id=
"page412"></a>{412}</span>
<p>24. And in the case of space also (the doctrine of its being a
non-entity is untenable) on account of its not differing (from the
two other kinds of non-entity).</p>
<p>We have shown so far that of the triad declared by the Bauddhas
to be devoid of all positive characteristics, and therefore
non-definable, two (viz. prati-sa<i>m</i>khy&acirc;virodha and
aprati) cannot be shown to be such; we now proceed to show the same
with regard to space (ether, &acirc;k&acirc;<i>s</i>a).</p>
<p>With regard to space also it cannot be maintained that it is
non-definable, since substantiality can be established in the case
of space no less than in the case of the two so-called non-entities
treated of in the preceding S&ucirc;tras. That space is a real
thing follows in the first place from certain scriptural passages,
such as 'space sprang from the Self.'&mdash;To those, again, who
(like the Bauddhas) disagree with us as to the authoritativeness of
Scripture we point out that the real existence of space is to be
inferred from the quality of sound, since we observe that earth and
other real things are the abodes of smell and the other
qualities.&mdash;Moreover, if you declare that space is nothing but
the absence in general of any covering (occupying) body, it would
follow that while one bird is flying&mdash;whereby space is
occupied&mdash;there would be no room for a second bird wanting to
fly at the same time. And if you should reply that the second bird
may fly there where there is absence of a covering body, we point
out that that something by which the absence of covering bodies is
distinguished must be a positive entity, viz. space in our sense,
and not the mere non-existence of covering bodies<a id=
"footnotetag402" name="footnotetag402"></a><a href=
"#footnote402"><sup>402</sup></a>.&mdash;Moreover, the Bauddha
places himself, by his view of space, in opposition to other parts
of his system. For we find, in the Bauddha Scriptures, a series of
questions and answers (beginning, 'On what, O reverend Sir, is the
earth founded?'), in which the following <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page413" id="page413"></a>{413}</span> question
occurs, 'On what is the air founded?' to which it is replied that
the air is founded on space (ether). Now it is clear that this
statement is appropriate only on the supposition of space being a
positive entity, not a mere negation.&mdash;Further, there is a
self-contradiction in the Bauddha statements regarding all the
three kinds of negative entities, it being said, on the one hand,
that they are not positively definable, and, on the other hand,
that they are eternal. Of what is not real neither eternity nor
non-eternity can be predicated, since the distinction of subjects
and predicates of attribution is founded entirely on real things.
Anything with regard to which that distinction holds good we
conclude to be a real thing, such as jars and the like are, not a
mere undefinable negation.</p>
<p>25. And on account of remembrance.</p>
<p>The philosopher who maintains that all things are momentary only
would have to extend that doctrine to the perceiving person
(upalabdh<i>ri</i>) also; that is, however, not possible, on
account of the remembrance which is consequent on the original
perception. That remembrance can take place only if it belongs to
the same person who previously made the perception; for we observe
that what one man has experienced is not remembered by another man.
How, indeed, could there arise the conscious state expressed in the
sentences, 'I saw that thing, and now I see this thing,' if the
seeing person were not in both cases the same? That the
consciousness of recognition takes place only in the case of the
observing and remembering subject being one, is a matter known to
every one; for if there were, in the two cases, different subjects,
the state of consciousness arising in the mind of the remembering
person would be, '<i>I</i> remember; another person made the
observation.' But no such state of consciousness does
arise.&mdash;When, on the other hand, such a state of consciousness
does arise, then everybody knows that the person who made the
original observation, and the person who remembers, are different
persons, and then the state of consciousness is expressed as
follows, 'I remember that that other person saw that and
that.'&mdash;In <span class="pagenum"><a name="page414" id=
"page414"></a>{414}</span> the case under discussion, however, the
Vain&acirc;<i>s</i>ika himself&mdash;whose state of consciousness
is, 'I saw that and that'&mdash;knows that there is one thinking
subject only to which the original perception as well as the
remembrance belongs, and does not think of denying that the past
perception belonged to himself, not any more than he denies that
fire is hot and gives light.</p>
<p>As thus one agent is connected with the two moments of
perception and subsequent remembrance, the Vain&acirc;<i>s</i>ika
has necessarily to abandon the doctrine of universal momentariness.
And if he further recognises all his subsequent successive
cognitions, up to his last breath, to belong to one and the same
subject, and in addition cannot but attribute all his past
cognitions, from the moment of his birth, to the same Self, how can
he maintain, without being ashamed of himself, that everything has
a momentary existence only? Should he maintain that the recognition
(of the subject as one and the same) takes place on account of the
similarity (of the different self-cognitions; each, however, being
momentary only), we reply that the cognition of similarity is based
on two things, and that for that reason the advocate of universal
momentariness who denies the existence of one (permanent) subject
able mentally to grasp the two similar things simply talks
deceitful nonsense when asserting that recognition is founded on
similarity. Should he admit, on the other hand, that there is one
mind grasping the similarity of two successive momentary
existences, he would thereby admit that one entity endures for two
moments and thus contradict the tenet of universal
momentariness.&mdash;Should it be said that the cognition 'this is
similar to that' is a different (new) cognition, not dependent on
the apperception of the earlier and later momentary existences, we
refute this by the remark that the fact of different
terms&mdash;viz. 'this' and 'that'&mdash;being used points to the
existence of different things (which the mind grasps in a judgment
of similarity). If the mental act of which similarity is the object
were an altogether new act (not concerned with the two separate
similar entities), the expression 'this is similar to that'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page415" id=
"page415"></a>{415}</span> would be devoid of meaning; we should in
that case rather speak of 'similarity' only.&mdash;Whenever (to add
a general reflexion) something perfectly well known from ordinary
experience is not admitted by philosophers, they may indeed
establish their own view and demolish the contrary opinion by means
of words, but they thereby neither convince others nor even
themselves. Whatever has been ascertained to be such and such must
also be represented as such and such; attempts to represent it as
something else prove nothing but the vain talkativeness of those
who make those attempts. Nor can the hypothesis of mere similarity
being cognised account for ordinary empirical life and thought; for
(in recognising a thing) we are conscious of it being that which we
were formerly conscious of, not of it being merely similar to that.
We admit that sometimes with regard to an external thing a doubt
may arise whether it is that or merely is similar to that; for
mistakes may be made concerning what lies outside our minds. But
the conscious subject never has any doubt whether it is itself or
only similar to itself; it rather is distinctly conscious that it
is one and the same subject which yesterday had a certain sensation
and to-day remembers that sensation.&mdash;For this reason also the
doctrine of the Nihilists is to be rejected.</p>
<p>26. (Entity) does not spring from non-entity on account of that
not being observed.</p>
<p>The system of the Vain&acirc;<i>s</i>ikas is objectionable for
this reason also that those who deny the existence of permanent
stable causes are driven to maintain that entity springs from
non-entity. This latter tenet is expressly enunciated by the
Bauddhas where they say, 'On account of the manifestation (of
effects) not without previous destruction (of the cause).' For,
they say, from the decomposed seed only the young plant springs,
spoilt milk only turns into curds, and the lump of clay has ceased
to be a lump when it becomes a jar. If effects did spring from the
unchanged causes, all effects would originate from all causes at
once, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page416" id=
"page416"></a>{416}</span> as then no specification would be
required<a id="footnotetag403" name="footnotetag403"></a><a href=
"#footnote403"><sup>403</sup></a>. Hence, as we see that young
plants, &amp;c. spring from seeds, &amp;c. only after the latter
have been merged in non-existence, we hold that entity springs from
non-entity.</p>
<p>To this Bauddha tenet we reply, '(Entity does) not (spring) from
non-entity, on account of that not being observed.' If entity did
spring from non-entity, the assumption of special causes would be
purportless, since non-entity is in all cases one and the same. For
the non-existence of seeds and the like after they have been
destroyed is of the same kind as the non-existence of horns of
hares and the like, i.e. non-existence is in all cases nothing else
but the absence of all character of reality, and hence there would
be no sense (on the doctrine of origination from non-existence) in
assuming that sprouts are produced from seeds only, curds from milk
only, and so on. And if non-distinguished non-existence were
admitted to have causal efficiency, we should also have to assume
that sprouts, &amp;c. originate from the horns of hares,
&amp;c.&mdash;a thing certainly not actually observed.&mdash;If,
again, it should be assumed that there are different kinds of
non-existence having special distinctions&mdash;just as, for
instance, blueness and the like are special qualities of lotuses
and so on&mdash;we point out that in that case the fact of there
being such special distinctions would turn the non-entities into
entities no less real than lotuses and the like. In no case
non-existence would possess causal efficiency, simply because, like
the horn of a hare, it is non-existence merely.&mdash;Further, if
existence sprang from non-existence, all effects would be affected
with non-existence; while as a matter of fact they are observed to
be merely positive entities distinguished by their various special
characteristics. Nor<a id="footnotetag404" name=
"footnotetag404"></a><a href="#footnote404"><sup>404</sup></a> does
any one <span class="pagenum"><a name="page417" id=
"page417"></a>{417}</span> think that things of the nature of clay,
such as pots and the like, are the effects of threads and the like;
but everybody knows that things of the nature of clay are the
effects of clay only.&mdash;The Bauddha's tenet that nothing can
become a cause as long as it remains unchanged, but has to that end
to undergo destruction, and that thus existence springs from
non-existence only is false; for it is observed that only things of
permanent nature which are always recognised as what they are, such
as gold, &amp;c., are the causes of effects such as golden
ornaments, and so on. In those cases where a destruction of the
peculiar nature of the cause is observed to take place, as in the
case of seeds, for instance, we have to acknowledge as the cause of
the subsequent condition (i.e. the sprout) not the earlier
condition in so far as it is destroyed, but rather those permanent
particles of the seed which are not destroyed (when the seed as a
whole undergoes decomposition).&mdash;Hence as we see on the one
hand that no entities ever originate from nonentities such as the
horns of a hare, and on the other hand that entities do originate
from entities such as gold and the like the whole Bauddha doctrine
of existence springing from non-existence has to be
rejected.&mdash;We finally point out that, according to the
Bauddhas, all mind and all mental modifications spring from the
four skandhas discussed above and all material aggregates from the
atoms; why then do they stultify this their own doctrine by the
fanciful assumption of entity springing from non-entity and thus
needlessly perplex the mind of every one?</p>
<p>27. And thus (on that doctrine) there would be an accomplishment
(of ends) in the case of non-active people also.</p>
<p>If it were admitted that entity issues from non-entity, lazy
inactive people also would obtain their purposes, since
'non-existence' is a thing to be had without much trouble. Rice
would grow for the husbandman even if he did not cultivate his
field; vessels would shape themselves even if the potter did not
fashion the clay; and the weaver too <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page418" id="page418"></a>{418}</span> lazy to weave the threads
into a whole, would nevertheless have in the end finished pieces of
cloth just as if he had been weaving. And nobody would have to
exert himself in the least either for going to the heavenly world
or for obtaining final release. All which of course is absurd and
not maintained by anybody.&mdash;Thus the doctrine of the
origination of entity from non-entity again shows itself to be
futile.</p>
<p>28. The non-existence (of external things) cannot be maintained,
on account of (our) consciousness (of them).</p>
<p>There having been brought forward, in what precedes, the various
objections which lie against the doctrine of the reality of the
external world (in the Bauddha sense), such as the impossibility of
accounting for the existence of aggregates, &amp;c., we are now
confronted by those Bauddhas who maintain that only cognitions (or
ideas, vij<i>&ntilde;</i>&acirc;na) exist.&mdash;The doctrine of
the reality of the external world was indeed propounded by Buddha
conforming himself to the mental state of some of his disciples
whom he perceived to be attached to external things; but it does
not represent his own true view according to which cognitions alone
are real.</p>
<p>According to this latter doctrine the process, whose
constituting members are the act of knowledge, the object of
knowledge, and the result of knowledge<a id="footnotetag405" name=
"footnotetag405"></a><a href="#footnote405"><sup>405</sup></a>, is
an altogether internal one, existing in so far only as it is
connected with the mind (buddhi). Even if external things existed,
that process could not take place but in connexion with the mind.
If, the Bauddhas say, you ask how it is known that that entire
process is internal and that no outward things exist apart from
consciousness, we reply that we base our <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page419" id="page419"></a>{419}</span> doctrine
on the impossibility of external things. For if external things are
admitted, they must be either atoms or aggregates of atoms such as
posts and the like. But atoms cannot be comprehended under the
ideas of posts and the like, it being impossible for cognition to
represent (things as minute as) atoms. Nor, again, can the outward
things be aggregates of atoms such as pillars and the like, because
those aggregates can neither be defined as different nor as
non-different from the atoms<a id="footnotetag406" name=
"footnotetag406"></a><a href=
"#footnote406"><sup>406</sup></a>.&mdash;In the same way we can
show that the external things are not universals and so on<a id=
"footnotetag407" name="footnotetag407"></a><a href=
"#footnote407"><sup>407</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Moreover, the cognitions&mdash;which are of a uniform nature
only in so far as they are states of consciousness&mdash;undergo,
according to their objects, successive modifications, so that there
is presented to the mind now the idea of a post, now the idea of a
wall, now the idea of a jar, and so on. Now this is not possible
without some distinction on the part of the ideas themselves, and
hence we must necessarily admit that the ideas have the same forms
as their objects. But if we make this admission, from which it
follows that the form of the objects is determined by the ideas,
the hypothesis of the existence of external things becomes
altogether gratuitous. From the fact, moreover, of our always being
conscious of the act of knowledge and the object of knowledge
simultaneously it follows that the two are in reality identical.
When we are conscious of the one we are conscious of the other
also; and that would not happen if the two were essentially
distinct, as in that case there would be nothing to prevent our
being conscious of one apart from the other. For this reason also
we maintain that there are no outward things.&mdash;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page420" id=
"page420"></a>{420}</span>
<p>Perception is to be considered as similar to a dream and the
like. The ideas present to our minds during a dream, a magical
illusion, a mirage and so on, appear in the twofold form of subject
and object, although there is all the while no external object;
hence we conclude that the ideas of posts and the like which occur
in our waking state are likewise independent of external objects;
for they also are simply ideas.&mdash;If we be asked how, in the
absence of external things, we account for the actual variety of
ideas, we reply that that variety is to be explained from the
impressions left by previous ideas<a id="footnotetag408" name=
"footnotetag408"></a><a href="#footnote408"><sup>408</sup></a>. In
the beginningless sa<i>m</i>s&acirc;ra ideas and mental impressions
succeed each other as causes and effects, just as the plant springs
from the seed and seeds are again produced from the plant, and
there exists therefore a sufficient reason for the variety of ideas
actually experienced. That the variety of ideas is solely due to
the impressions left on the mind by past ideas follows, moreover,
from the following affirmative and negative judgments: we both (the
Ved&acirc;ntins as well as the Bauddhas) admit that in dreams,
&amp;c. there presents itself a variety of ideas which arise from
mental impressions, without any external object; we (the Bauddhas)
do not admit that any variety of ideas can arise from external
objects, without mental impressions.&mdash;Thus we are again led to
conclude that no outward things exist.</p>
<p>To all this we (the Ved&acirc;ntins) make the following
reply.&mdash;The non-existence of external things cannot be
maintained because we are conscious of external things. In every
act of perception we are conscious of some external thing
corresponding to the idea, whether it be a post or a wall or a
piece of cloth or a jar, and that of which we are conscious cannot
but exist. Why should we pay attention to the words of a man who,
while conscious of an outward thing through its approximation to
his senses, affirms that he is conscious of no outward thing, and
that no such thing exists, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page421"
id="page421"></a>{421}</span> any more than we listen to a man who
while he is eating and experiencing the feeling of satisfaction
avers that he does not eat and does not feel satisfied?&mdash;If
the Bauddha should reply that he does not affirm that he is
conscious of no object but only that he is conscious of no object
apart from the act of consciousness, we answer that he may indeed
make any arbitrary statement he likes, but that he has no arguments
to prove what he says. That the outward thing exists apart from
consciousness, has necessarily to be accepted on the ground of the
nature of consciousness itself. Nobody when perceiving a post or a
wall is conscious of his perception only, but all men are conscious
of posts and walls and the like as objects of their perceptions.
That such is the consciousness of all men, appears also from the
fact that even those who contest the existence of external things
bear witness to their existence when they say that what is an
internal object of cognition appears like something external. For
they practically accept the general consciousness, which testifies
to the existence of an external world, and being at the same time
anxious to refute it they speak of the external things as 'like
something external.' If they did not themselves at the bottom
acknowledge the existence of the external world, how could they use
the expression 'like something external?' No one says,
'Vish<i>n</i>umitra appears like the son of a barren mother.' If we
accept the truth as it is given to us in our consciousness, we must
admit that the object of perception appears to us as something
external, not like something external.&mdash;But&mdash;the Bauddha
may reply&mdash;we conclude that the object of perception is only
like something external because external things are
impossible.&mdash;This conclusion we rejoin is improper, since the
possibility or impossibility of things is to be determined only on
the ground of the operation or non-operation of the means of right
knowledge; while on the other hand, the operation and non-operation
of the means of right knowledge are not to be made dependent on
preconceived possibilities or impossibilities. Possible is whatever
is apprehended by perception or some other means of proof;
impossible is what is not so apprehended. Now the external things
are, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page422" id=
"page422"></a>{422}</span> according to their nature, apprehended
by all the instruments of knowledge; how then can you maintain that
they are not possible, on the ground of such idle dilemmas as that
about their difference or non-difference from atoms?&mdash;Nor,
again, does the non-existence of objects follow from the fact of
the ideas having the same form as the objects; for if there were no
objects the ideas could not have the forms of the objects, and the
objects are actually apprehended as external.&mdash;For the same
reason (i.e. because the distinction of thing and idea is given in
consciousness) the invariable concomitance of idea and thing has to
be considered as proving only that the thing constitutes the means
of the idea, not that the two are identical. Moreover, when we are
conscious first of a pot and then of a piece of cloth,
consciousness remains the same in the two acts while what varies
are merely the distinctive attributes of consciousness; just as
when we see at first a black and then a white cow, the distinction
of the two perceptions is due to the varying blackness and
whiteness while the generic character of the cow remains the same.
The difference of the one permanent factor (from the two&mdash;or
more&mdash;varying factors) is proved throughout by the two varying
factors, and vice vers&acirc; the difference of the latter (from
the permanent factor) by the presence of the one (permanent
factor). Therefore thing and idea are distinct. The same view is to
be held with regard to the perception and the remembrance of a jar;
there also the perception and the remembrance only are distinct
while the jar is one and the same; in the same way as when
conscious of the smell of milk and the taste of milk we are
conscious of the smell and taste as different things but of the
milk itself as one only.</p>
<p>Further, two ideas which occupy different moments of time and
pass away as soon as they have become objects of consciousness
cannot apprehend&mdash;or be apprehended by&mdash;each other. From
this it follows that certain doctrines forming part of the Bauddha
system cannot be upheld; so the doctrine that ideas are different
from each other; the doctrine that everything is momentary, void,
&amp;c.; the doctrine of the distinction of individuals and
classes; the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page423" id=
"page423"></a>{423}</span> doctrine that a former idea leaves an
impression giving rise to a later idea; the doctrine of the
distinction, owing to the influence of Nescience, of the attributes
of existence and non-existence; the doctrine of bondage and release
(depending on absence and presence of right knowledge)<a id=

<p>Further, if you say that we are conscious of the idea, you must
admit that we are also conscious of the external thing. And if you
rejoin that we are conscious of the idea on its own account because
it is of a luminous nature like a lamp, while the external thing is
not so; we reply that by maintaining the idea to be illuminated by
itself you make yourself guilty of an absurdity no less than if you
said that fire burns itself. And at the same time you refuse to
accept the common and altogether rational opinion that we are
conscious of the external thing by means of the idea different from
the thing! Indeed a proof of extraordinary philosophic
insight!&mdash;It cannot, moreover, be asserted in any way that the
idea apart from the thing is the object of our consciousness; for
it is absurd to speak of a thing as the object of its own activity.
Possibly you (the Bauddha) will rejoin that, if the idea is to be
apprehended by something different from it, that something also
must be apprehended by something different and so on ad infinitum.
And, moreover, you will perhaps object that as each cognition is of
an essentially illuminating nature like a lamp, the assumption of a
further cognition is uncalled for; for as they are both equally
illuminating the one cannot give light to the other.&mdash;But both
these objections are unfounded. As the idea only is apprehended,
and there is consequently no necessity to assume something to
apprehend the Self which witnesses the idea (is conscious of the
idea), there results no regressus ad infinitum. And the witnessing
Self and the idea are of an essentially different nature, and may
therefore stand to each other in the relation of knowing subject
and object known. The existence of the witnessing <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page424" id="page424"></a>{424}</span> Self is
self-proved and cannot therefore be denied.&mdash;Moreover, if you
maintain that the idea, lamplike, manifests itself without standing
in need of a further principle to illuminate it, you maintain
thereby that ideas exist which are not apprehended by any of the
means of knowledge, and which are without a knowing being; which is
no better than to assert that a thousand lamps burning inside some
impenetrable mass of rocks manifest themselves. And if you should
maintain that thereby we admit your doctrine, since it follows from
what we have said that the idea itself implies consciousness; we
reply that, as observation shows, the lamp in order to become
manifest requires some other intellectual agent furnished with
instruments such as the eye, and that therefore the idea also, as
equally being a thing to be illuminated, becomes manifest only
through an ulterior intelligent principle. And if you finally
object that we, when advancing the witnessing Self as self-proved,
merely express in other words the Bauddha tenet that the idea is
self-manifested, we refute you by remarking that your ideas have
the attributes of originating, passing away, being manifold, and so
on (while our Self is one and permanent).&mdash;We thus have proved
that an idea, like a lamp, requires an ulterior intelligent
principle to render it manifest.</p>
<p>29. And on account of their difference of nature (the ideas of
the waking state) are not like those of a dream.</p>
<p>We now apply ourselves to the refutation of the averment made by
the Bauddha, that the ideas of posts, and so on, of which we are
conscious in the waking state, may arise in the absence of external
objects, just as the ideas of a dream, both being ideas
alike.&mdash;The two sets of ideas, we maintain, cannot be treated
on the same footing, on account of the difference of their
character. They differ as follows.&mdash;The things of which we are
conscious in a dream are negated by our waking consciousness. 'I
wrongly thought that I had a meeting with a great man; no such
meeting took place, but my mind was dulled by slumber, and so the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page425" id=
"page425"></a>{425}</span> false idea arose.' In an analogous
manner the things of which we are conscious when under the
influence of a magic illusion, and the like, are negated by our
ordinary consciousness. Those things, on the other hand, of which
we are conscious in our waking state, such as posts and the like,
are never negated in any state.&mdash;Moreover, the visions of a
dream are acts of remembrance, while the visions of the waking
state are acts of immediate consciousness; and the distinction
between remembrance and immediate consciousness is directly
cognised by every one as being founded on the absence or presence
of the object. When, for instance, a man remembers his absent son,
he does not directly perceive him, but merely wishes so to perceive
him. As thus the distinction between the two states is evident to
every one, it is impossible to formulate the inference that waking
consciousness is false because it is mere consciousness, such as
dreaming consciousness; for we certainly cannot allow would-be
philosophers to deny the truth of what is directly evident to
themselves. Just because they feel the absurdity of denying what is
evident to themselves, and are consequently unable to demonstrate
the baselessness of the ideas of the waking state from those ideas
themselves, they attempt to demonstrate it from their having
certain attributes in common with the ideas of the dreaming state.
But if some attribute cannot belong to a thing on account of the
latter's own nature, it cannot belong to it on account of the thing
having certain attributes in common with some other thing. Fire,
which is felt to be hot, cannot be demonstrated to be cold, on the
ground of its having attributes in common with water. And the
difference of nature between the waking and the sleeping state we
have already shown.</p>
<p>30. The existence (of mental impressions) is not possible on the
Bauddha view, on account of the absence of perception (of external
things).</p>
<p>We now proceed to that theory of yours, according to which the
variety of ideas can be explained from the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page426" id="page426"></a>{426}</span> variety
of mental impressions, without any reference to external things,
and remark that on your doctrine the existence of mental
impressions is impossible, as you do not admit the perception of
external things. For the variety of mental impressions is caused
altogether by the variety of the things perceived. How, indeed,
could various impressions originate if no external things were
perceived? The hypothesis of a beginningless series of mental
impressions would lead only to a baseless regressus ad infinitum,
sublative of the entire phenomenal world, and would in no way
establish your position.&mdash;The same argument, i.e. the one
founded on the impossibility of mental impressions which are not
caused by external things, refutes also the positive and negative
judgments, on the ground of which the denier of an external world
above attempted to show that ideas are caused by mental
impressions, not by external things. We rather have on our side a
positive and a negative judgment whereby to establish our doctrine
of the existence of external things, viz. 'the perception of
external things is admitted to take place also without mental
impressions,' and 'mental impressions are not admitted to originate
independently of the perception of external
things.'&mdash;Moreover, an impression is a kind of modification,
and modifications cannot, as experience teaches, take place unless
there is some substratum which is modified. But, according to your
doctrine, such a substratum of impressions does not exist, since
you say that it cannot be cognised through any means of
knowledge.</p>
<p>31. And on account of the momentariness (of the
&acirc;layavij<i>&ntilde;</i>&acirc;na, it cannot be the abode of
mental impressions).</p>
<p>If you maintain that the so-called internal cognition
(&acirc;layavij<i>&ntilde;</i>&acirc;na<a id="footnotetag410" name=
"footnotetag410"></a><a href="#footnote410"><sup>410</sup></a>)
assumed by you may constitute the abode <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page427" id="page427"></a>{427}</span> of the
mental impressions, we deny that, because that cognition also being
admittedly momentary, and hence non-permanent, cannot be the abode
of impressions any more than the quasi-external cognitions
(prav<i>ri</i>ttivij<i>&ntilde;</i>&acirc;na). For unless there
exists one continuous principle equally connected with the past,
the present, and the future<a id="footnotetag411" name=
"footnotetag411"></a><a href="#footnote411"><sup>411</sup></a>, or
an absolutely unchangeable (Self) which cognises everything, we are
unable to account for remembrance, recognition, and so on, which
are subject to mental impressions dependent on place, time, and
cause. If, on the other hand, you declare your
&acirc;layavij<i>&ntilde;</i>&acirc;na to be something permanent,
you thereby abandon your tenet of the
&acirc;layavij<i>&ntilde;</i>&acirc;na as well as everything else
being momentary.&mdash;Or (to explain the S&ucirc;tra in a
different way) as the tenet of general momentariness is
characteristic of the systems of the idealistic as well as the
realistic Bauddhas, we may bring forward against the doctrines of
the former all those arguments dependent on the principle of
general momentariness which we have above urged against the
latter.</p>
<p>We have thus refuted both nihilistic doctrines, viz. the
doctrine which maintains the (momentary) reality of the external
world, and the doctrine which asserts that ideas only exist. The
third variety of Bauddha doctrine, viz. that everything is empty
(i.e. that absolutely nothing exists), is contradicted by all means
of right knowledge, and therefore requires no special refutation.
For this apparent world, whose existence is guaranteed by all the
means of knowledge, cannot be denied, unless some one should find
out some new truth (based on which he could impugn its
existence)&mdash;for a general principle is proved by the absence
of contrary instances.</p>
<p>32. And on account of its general deficiency in probability.</p>
<p>No further special discussion is in fact required. From
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page428" id=
"page428"></a>{428}</span> whatever new points of view the Bauddha
system is tested with reference to its probability, it gives way on
all sides, like the walls of a well dug in sandy soil. It has, in
fact, no foundation whatever to rest upon, and hence the attempts
to use it as a guide in the practical concerns of life are mere
folly.&mdash;Moreover, Buddha by propounding the three mutually
contradictory systems, teaching respectively the reality of the
external world, the reality of ideas only, and general nothingness,
has himself made it clear either that he was a man given to make
incoherent assertions, or else that hatred of all beings induced
him to propound absurd doctrines by accepting which they would
become thoroughly confused.&mdash;So that&mdash;and this the
S&ucirc;tra means to indicate&mdash;Buddha's doctrine has to be
entirely disregarded by all those who have a regard for their own
happiness.</p>
<p>33. On account of the impossibility (of contradictory
attributes) in one thing, (the Jaina doctrine is) not (to be
accepted).</p>
<p>Having disposed of the Bauddha doctrine we now turn to the
system of the Gymnosophists (Jainas).</p>
<p>The Jainas acknowledge seven categories (tattvas), viz. soul
(j&icirc;va), non-soul (aj&icirc;va), the issuing outward
(&acirc;srava), restraint (sa<i>m</i>vara), destruction (nirjara),
bondage (bandha), and release (moksha)<a id="footnotetag412" name=
"footnotetag412"></a><a href="#footnote412"><sup>412</sup></a>.
Shortly it may be said that they acknowledge two categories, viz.
soul and non-soul, since the five other categories may be subsumed
under these two.&mdash;They also set forth a set of categories
different from the two mentioned. They teach that there are five
so-called <span class="pagenum"><a name="page429" id=
"page429"></a>{429}</span> astik&acirc;yas ('existing bodies,' i.e.
categories), viz. the categories of soul (j&icirc;va), body
(pudgala), merit (dharma), demerit (adharma), and space
(&acirc;k&acirc;<i>s</i>a). All these categories they again
subdivide in various fanciful ways<a id="footnotetag413" name=
"footnotetag413"></a><a href=
"#footnote413"><sup>413</sup></a>.&mdash;To all things they apply
the following method of reasoning, which they call the
saptabha@ng&icirc;naya: somehow it is; somehow it is not; somehow
it is and is not; somehow it is indescribable; somehow it is and is
indescribable; somehow it is not and is indescribable; somehow it
is and is not and is indescribable.</p>
<p>To this unsettling style of reasoning they submit even such
conceptions as that of unity and eternity<a id="footnotetag414"
name="footnotetag414"></a><a href=
"#footnote414"><sup>414</sup></a>.</p>
<p>This doctrine we meet as follows.&mdash;Your reasoning, we say,
is inadmissible 'on account of the impossibility in one thing.'
That is to say, it is impossible that contradictory attributes such
as being and non-being should at the same time belong to one and
the same thing; just as observation teaches us that a thing cannot
be hot and cold at the same moment. The seven categories asserted
by you must either be so many and such or not be so many and such;
the third alternative expressed in the words 'they either are such
or not such' results in a cognition of indefinite nature which is
no more a source of true knowledge than doubt is. If you should
plead that the cognition that a thing is of more than one nature is
definite and therefore a source of true knowledge, we deny this.
For the unlimited assertion that all things are of a non-exclusive
nature is itself something, falls as such under the alternative
predications 'somehow it is,' 'somehow it is not,' and so ceases to
be a definite assertion. The same happens to the person making the
assertion and to the result of the assertion; partly they are,
partly they are not. As thus the means of knowledge, the object of
knowledge, the knowing subject, and the act of knowledge are all
alike indefinite, how can the T&icirc;rthakara (Jina) teach with
any claim to authority, and how can his followers act on a doctrine
the matter of which is altogether <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page430" id="page430"></a>{430}</span> indeterminate? Observation
shows that only when a course of action is known to have a definite
result people set about it without hesitation. Hence a man who
proclaims a doctrine of altogether indefinite contents does not
deserve to be listened to any more than a drunken man or a
madman.&mdash;Again, if we apply the Jaina reasoning to their
doctrine of the five categories, we have to say that on one view of
the matter they are five and on another view they are not five;
from which latter point of view it follows that they are either
fewer or more than five. Nor is it logical to declare the
categories to be indescribable. For if they are so, they cannot be
described; but, as a matter of fact, they are described so that to
call them indescribable involves a contradiction. And if you go on
to say that the categories on being described are ascertained to be
such and such, and at the same time are not ascertained to be such
and such, and that the result of their being ascertained is perfect
knowledge or is not perfect knowledge, and that imperfect knowledge
is the opposite of perfect knowledge or is not the opposite; you
certainly talk more like a drunken or insane man than like a sober,
trustworthy person.&mdash;If you further maintain that the heavenly
world and final release exist or do not exist and are eternal or
non-eternal, the absence of all determinate knowledge which is
implied in such statements will result in nobody's acting for the
purpose of gaining the heavenly world and final release. And,
moreover, it follows from your doctrine that soul, non-soul, and so
on, whose nature you claim to have ascertained, and which you
describe as having existed from all eternity, relapse all at once
into the condition of absolute indetermination.&mdash;As therefore
the two contradictory attributes of being and non-being cannot
belong to any of the categories&mdash;being excluding non-being and
vice vers&acirc; non-being excluding being&mdash;the doctrine of
the &Acirc;rhat must be rejected.&mdash;The above remarks dispose
likewise of the assertions made by the Jainas as to the
impossibility of deciding whether of one thing there is to be
predicated oneness or plurality, permanency or non-permanency,
separateness or norn-separateness, and so on.&mdash;The Jaina
doctrine that <span class="pagenum"><a name="page431" id=
"page431"></a>{431}</span> aggregates are formed from the
atoms&mdash;by them called pudgalas&mdash;we do not undertake to
refute separately as its refutation is already comprised in that of
the atomistic doctrine given in a previous part of this work.</p>
<p>34. And likewise (there results from the Jaina, doctrine)
non-universality of the Self.</p>
<p>We have hitherto urged against the Jaina doctrine an objection
resulting from the sy&acirc;dv&acirc;da, viz. that one thing cannot
have contradictory attributes. We now turn to the objection that
from their doctrine it would follow that the individual Self is not
universal, i.e. not omnipresent.&mdash;The Jainas are of opinion
that the soul has the same size as the body. From this it would
follow that the soul is not of infinite extension, but limited, and
hence non-eternal like jars and similar things. Further, as the
bodies of different classes of creatures are of different size, it
might happen that the soul of a man&mdash;which is of the size of
the human body&mdash;when entering, in consequence of its former
deeds, on a new state of existence in the body of an elephant would
not be able to fill the whole of it; or else that a human soul
being relegated to the body of an ant would not be able to find
sufficient room in it. The same difficulty would, moreover, arise
with regard to the successive stages of one state of existence,
infancy, youth, and old age.&mdash;But why, the Jaina may ask,
should we not look upon the soul as consisting of an infinite
number of parts capable of undergoing compression in a small body
and dilatation in a big one?&mdash;Do you, we ask in return, admit
or not admit that those countless particles of the soul may occupy
the same place or not?&mdash;If you do not admit it, it follows
that the infinite number of particles cannot be contained in a body
of limited dimensions.&mdash;If you do admit it, it follows that,
as then the space occupied by all the particles may be the space of
one particle only, the extension of all the particles together will
remain inconsiderable, and hence the soul be of minute size (not of
the size of the body). You have, moreover, no right to assume that
a body <span class="pagenum"><a name="page432" id=
"page432"></a>{432}</span> of limited size contains an infinite
number of soul particles.</p>
<p>Well the, the Jaina may reply, let us assume that by turns
whenever the soul enters a big body some particles accede to it
while some withdraw from it whenever it enters a small
body.&mdash;To this hypothesis the next S&ucirc;tra furnishes a
reply.</p>
<p>35. Nor is non-contradiction to be derived from the succession
(of parts acceding to and departing from the soul), on account of
the change, &amp;c. (of the soul).</p>
<p>Nor can the doctrine of the soul having the same size as the
body be satisfactorily established by means of the hypothesis of
the successive accession and withdrawal of particles. For this
hypothesis would involve the soul's undergoing changes and the
like. If the soul is continually being repleted and depleted by the
successive addition and withdrawal of parts, it of course follows
that it undergoes change, and if it is liable to change it follows
that it is non-permanent, like the skin and similar substances.
From that, again, it follows that the Jaina doctrine of bondage and
release is untenable; according to which doctrine 'the soul, which
in the state of bondage is encompassed by the ogdoad of works and
sunk in the ocean of sa<i>m</i>s&acirc;ra, rises when its bonds are
sundered, as the gourd rises to the surface of the water when it is
freed from the encumbering clay<a id="footnotetag415" name=
"footnotetag415"></a><a href=
"#footnote415"><sup>415</sup></a>.'&mdash;Moreover, those particles
which in turns come and depart have the attributes of coming and
going, and cannot, on that account, be of the nature of the Self
any more than the body is. And if it be said that the Self consists
of some permanently remaining parts, we remark that it would be
impossible to determine which are the permanent and which the
temporary parts.&mdash;We have further to ask from whence those
particles originate when they accede to the soul, and into what
they are merged when they detach themselves from it. They cannot
spring from the material elements <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page433" id="page433"></a>{433}</span> and re-enter the elements;
for the soul is immaterial. Nor have we any means to prove the
existence of some other, general or special, reservoir of
soul-particles.&mdash;Moreover, on the hypothesis under discussion
the soul would be of indefinite nature, as the size of the
particles acceding and departing is itself indefinite.&mdash;On
account of all these and similar difficulties it cannot be
maintained that certain particles by turns attach themselves to,
and detach themselves from, the soul.</p>
<p>The S&ucirc;tra may be taken in a different sense also. The
preceding S&ucirc;tra has proved that the soul if of the same size
as the body cannot be permanent, as its entering into bigger and
smaller bodies involves its limitation. To this the Gymnosophist
may be supposed to rejoin that although the soul's size
successively changes it may yet be permanent, just as the stream of
water is permanent (although the water continually changes). An
analogous instance would be supplied by the permanency of the
stream of ideas while the individual ideas, as that of a red cloth
and so on, are non-permanent.&mdash;To this rejoinder our
S&ucirc;tra replies that if the stream is not real we are led back
to the doctrine of a general void, and that, if it is something
real, the difficulties connected with the soul's changing, &amp;c.
present themselves and render the Jaina view impossible.</p>
<p>36. And on account of the permanency of the final (size of the
soul) and the resulting permanency of the two (preceding sizes)
there is no difference (of size, at any time).</p>
<p>Moreover, the Jainas themselves admit the permanency of the
final size of the soul which it has in the state of release. From
this it follows also that its initial size and its intervening
sizes must be permanent<a id="footnotetag416" name=
"footnotetag416"></a><a href="#footnote416"><sup>416</sup></a>, and
that hence <span class="pagenum"><a name="page434" id=
"page434"></a>{434}</span> there is no difference between the three
sizes. But this would involve the conclusion that the different
bodies of the soul have one and the same size, and that the soul
cannot enter into bigger and smaller bodies.&mdash;Or else (to
explain the S&ucirc;tra in a somewhat different way) from the fact
that the final size of the soul is permanent, it follows that its
size in the two previous conditions also is permanent. Hence the
soul must be considered as being always of the same
size&mdash;whether minute or infinite&mdash;and not of the varying
size of its bodies.&mdash;For this reason also the doctrine of the
Arhat has to be set aside as not in any way more rational than the
doctrine of Buddha.</p>
<p>37. The Lord (cannot be the cause of the world), on account of
the inappropriateness (of that doctrine).</p>
<p>The S&ucirc;trak&acirc;ra now applies himself to the refutation
of that doctrine, according to which the Lord is the cause of the
world only in so far as he is the general ruler.&mdash;But how do
you know that that is the purport of the S&ucirc;tra (which speaks
of the Lord 'without any qualification')?&mdash;From the
circumstance, we reply, that the teacher himself has proved, in the
previous sections of the work, that the Lord is the material cause
as well as the ruler of the world. Hence, if the present
S&ucirc;tra were meant to impugn the doctrine of the Lord in
general, the earlier and later parts of the work would be mutually
contradictory, and the S&ucirc;trak&acirc;ra would thus be in
conflict with himself. We therefore must assume that the purport of
the present S&ucirc;tra is to make an energetic attack on the
doctrine of those who maintain that the Lord is not the material
cause, but merely the ruler, i.e. the operative cause of the world;
a doctrine entirely opposed to the Ved&acirc;ntic tenet of the
unity of Brahman.</p>
<p>The theories about the Lord which are independent of the
Ved&acirc;nta are of various nature. Some taking their stand on the
S&acirc;@nkhya and Yoga systems assume that the Lord acts as a mere
operative cause, as the ruler of the <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page435" id="page435"></a>{435}</span> pradh&acirc;na and of the
souls, and that pradh&acirc;na, soul, and Lord are of mutually
different nature.&mdash;The M&aacute;he<i>s</i>varas
(<i>S</i>aivas) maintain that the five categories, viz. effect,
cause, union, ritual, the end of pain, were taught by the Lord
Pa<i>s</i>upati (<i>S</i>iva) to the end of breaking the bonds of
the animal (i.e. the soul); Pa<i>s</i>upati is, according to them,
the Lord, the operative cause.&mdash;Similarly, the
Vai<i>s</i>eshikas and others also teach, according to their
various systems, that the Lord is somehow the operative cause of
the world.</p>
<p>Against all these opinions the S&ucirc;tra remarks 'the Lord, on
account of the inappropriateness.' I.e. it is not possible that the
Lord as the ruler of the pradh&acirc;na and the soul should be the
cause of the world, on account of the inappropriateness of that
doctrine. For if the Lord is supposed to assign to the various
classes of animate creatures low, intermediate, and high positions,
according to his liking, it follows that he is animated by hatred,
passion, and so on, is hence like one of us, and is no real Lord.
Nor can we get over this difficulty by assuming that he makes his
dispositions with a view to the merit and demerit of the living
beings; for that assumption would lead us to a logical see-saw, the
Lord as well as the works of living beings having to be considered
in turns both as acting and as acted upon. This difficulty is not
removed by the consideration that the works of living beings and
the resulting dispositions made by the Lord form a chain which has
no beginning; for in past time as well as in the present mutual
interdependence of the two took place, so that the beginningless
series is like an endless chain of blind men leading other blind
men. It is, moreover, a tenet set forth by the Naiy&acirc;yikas
themselves that 'imperfections have the characteristic of being the
causes of action' (Ny&acirc;ya S&ugrave;tra I, 1, 18). Experience
shows that all agents, whether they be active for their own
purposes or for the purposes of something else, are impelled to
action by some imperfection. And even if it is admitted that an
agent even when acting for some extrinsic purpose is impelled by an
intrinsic motive, your doctrine remains faulty all the same; for
the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page436" id=
"page436"></a>{436}</span> Lord is no longer a Lord, even if he is
actuated by intrinsic motives only (such as the desire of removing
the painful feeling connected with pity).&mdash;Your doctrine is
finally inappropriate for that reason also that you maintain the
Lord to be a special kind of soul; for from that it follows that he
must be devoid of all activity.</p>
<p>38. And on account of the impossibility of the connexion (of the
Lord with the souls and the pradh&acirc;na).</p>
<p>Against the doctrine which we are at present discussing there
lies the further objection that a Lord distinct from the
pradh&acirc;na and the souls cannot be the ruler of the latter
without being connected with them in a certain way. But of what
nature is that connexion to be? It cannot be conjunction
(sa<i>m</i>yoga), because the Lord, as well as the pradh&acirc;na
and the souls, is of infinite extent and devoid of parts. Nor can
it be inherence, since it would be impossible to define who should
be the abode and who the abiding thing. Nor is it possible to
assume some other connexion, the special nature of which would have
to be inferred from the effect, because the relation of cause and
effect is just what is not settled as yet<a id="footnotetag417"
name="footnotetag417"></a><a href=
"#footnote417"><sup>417</sup></a>.&mdash;How, then, it may be
asked, do you&mdash;the Ved&acirc;ntins&mdash;establish the
relation of cause and effect (between the Lord and the
world)?&mdash;There is, we reply, no difficulty in our case, as the
connexion we assume is that of identity (t&acirc;d&acirc;tmya). The
adherent of Brahman, moreover, defines the nature of the cause, and
so on, on the basis of Scripture, and is therefore not obliged to
render his tenets throughout conformable to observation. Our
adversary, on the other hand, who defines the nature of the cause
and the like according to instances furnished by experience,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page437" id=
"page437"></a>{437}</span> may be expected to maintain only such
doctrines as agree with experience. Nor can he put forward the
claim that Scripture, because it is the production of the
omniscient Lord, may be used to confirm his doctrine as well as
that of the Ved&acirc;ntin; for that would involve him in a logical
see-saw, the omniscience of the Lord being established on the
doctrine of Scripture, and the authority of Scripture again being
established on the omniscience of the Lord.&mdash;For all these
reasons the S&acirc;@nkhya-yoga hypothesis about the Lord is devoid
of foundation. Other similar hypotheses which likewise are not
based on the Veda are to be refuted by corresponding arguments.</p>
<p>39. And on account of the impossibility of rulership (on the
part of the Lord).</p>
<p>The Lord of the argumentative philosophers is an untenable
hypothesis, for the following reason also.&mdash;Those philosophers
are obliged to assume that by his influence the Lord produces
action in the pradh&acirc;na, &amp;c. just as the potter produces
motion in the clay, &amp;c. But this cannot be admitted; for the
pradh&acirc;na, which is devoid of colour and other qualities, and
therefore not an object of perception, is on that account of an
altogether different nature from clay and the like, and hence
cannot be looked upon as the object of the Lord's action.</p>
<p>40. If you say that as the organs (are ruled by the soul so the
pradh&acirc;na is ruled by the Lord), we deny that on account of
the enjoyment, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Well, the opponent might reply, let us suppose that the Lord
rules the pradh&acirc;na in the same way as the soul rules the
organ of sight and the other organs which are devoid of colour, and
so on, and hence not objects of perception.</p>
<p>This analogy also, we reply, proves nothing. For we infer that
the organs are ruled by the soul, from the observed fact that the
soul feels pleasure, pain, and the like (which affect the soul
through the organs). But we do not observe that the Lord
experiences pleasure, pain, &amp;c. caused <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page438" id="page438"></a>{438}</span> by the
pradh&acirc;na. If the analogy between the pradh&acirc;na and the
bodily organs were a complete one, it would follow that the Lord is
affected by pleasure and pain no less than the transmigrating souls
are.</p>
<p>Or else the two preceding S&ucirc;tras may be explained in a
different way. Ordinary experience teaches us that kings, who are
the rulers of countries, are never without some material abode,
i.e. a body; hence, if we wish to infer the existence of a general
Lord from the analogy of earthly rulers, we must ascribe to him
also some kind of body to serve as the substratum of his organs.
But such a body cannot be ascribed to the Lord, since all bodies
exist only subsequently to the creation, not previously to it. The
Lord, therefore, is not able to act because devoid of a material
substratum; for experience teaches us that action requires a
material substrate.&mdash;Let us then arbitrarily assume that the
Lord possesses some kind of body serving as a substratum for his
organs (even previously to creation).&mdash;This assumption also
will not do; for if the Lord has a body he is subject to the
sensations of ordinary transmigratory souls, and thus no longer is
the Lord.</p>
<p>41. And (there would follow from that doctrine) either finite
duration or absence of omniscience (on the Lord's part).</p>
<p>The hypothesis of the argumentative philosophers is invalid, for
the following reason also.&mdash;They teach that the Lord is
omniscient and of infinite duration, and likewise that the
pradh&acirc;na, as well as the individual souls, is of infinite
duration. Now, the omniscient Lord either defines the measure of
the pradh&acirc;na, the souls, and himself, or does not define it.
Both alternatives subvert the doctrine under discussion. For, on
the former alternative, the pradh&acirc;na, the souls, and the
Lord, being all of them of definite measure, must necessarily be of
finite duration; since ordinary experience teaches that all things
of definite extent, such as jars and the like, at some time cease
to exist. The numerical measure of pradh&acirc;na, souls, and Lord
is <span class="pagenum"><a name="page439" id=
"page439"></a>{439}</span> defined by their constituting a triad,
and the individual measure of each of them must likewise be
considered as defined by the Lord (because he is omniscient). The
number of the souls is a high one<a id="footnotetag418" name=
"footnotetag418"></a><a href="#footnote418"><sup>418</sup></a>.
From among this limited number of souls some obtain release from
the sa<i>m</i>s&acirc;ra, that means their sa<i>m</i>s&acirc;ra
comes to an end, and their subjection to the sams&acirc;ra comes to
an end. Gradually all souls obtain release, and so there will
finally be an end of the entire sa<i>m</i>s&acirc;ra and the
sa<i>m</i>s&acirc;ra state of all souls. But the pradh&acirc;na
which is ruled by the Lord and which modifies itself for the
purposes of the soul is what is meant by sa<i>m</i>s&acirc;ra.
Hence, when the latter no longer exists, nothing is left for the
Lord to rule, and his omniscience and ruling power have no longer
any objects. But if the pradh&acirc;na, the souls, and the Lord,
all have an end, it follows that they also have a beginning, and if
they have a beginning as well as an end, we are driven to the
doctrine of a general void.&mdash;Let us then, in order to avoid
these untoward conclusions, maintain the second alternative, i.e.
that the measure of the Lord himself, the pradh&acirc;na, and the
souls, is not defined by the Lord.&mdash;But that also is
impossible, because it would compel us to abandon a tenet granted
at the outset, viz. that the Lord is omniscient.</p>
<p>For all these reasons the doctrine of the argumentative
philosophers, according to which the Lord is the operative cause of
the world, appears unacceptable.</p>
<p>42. On account of the impossibility of the origination (of the
individual soul from the highest Lord, the doctrine of the
Bh&acirc;gavatas cannot be accepted).</p>
<p>We have, in what precedes, refuted the opinion of those who
think that the Lord is not the material cause but only the ruler,
the operative cause of the world. We are now <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page440" id="page440"></a>{440}</span> going to
refute the doctrine of those according to whom he is the material
as well as the operative cause.&mdash;But, it may be objected, in
the previous portions of the present work a Lord of exactly the
same nature, i.e. a Lord who is the material, as well as the
operative, cause of the world, has been ascertained on the basis of
Scripture, and it is a recognised principle that Sm<i>ri</i>ti, in
so far as it agrees with Scripture, is authoritative; why then
should we aim at controverting the doctrine stated?&mdash;It is
true, we reply, that a part of the system which we are going to
discuss agrees with the Ved&acirc;nta system, and hence affords no
matter for controversy; another part of the system, however, is
open to objection, and that part we intend to attack.</p>
<p>The so-called Bh&acirc;gavatas are of opinion that the one holy
(bhagavat) V&acirc;sudeva, whose nature is pure knowledge, is what
really exists, and that he, dividing himself fourfold, appears in
four forms (vy&ucirc;ha), as V&acirc;sudeva, Sa@nkarsha<i>n</i>a,
Pradyumna, and Aniruddha. V&acirc;sudeva denotes the highest Self,
Sa@nkarsha<i>n</i>a the individual soul, Pradyumna the mind
(manas), Aniruddha the principle of egoity (aha@nk&acirc;ra). Of
these four V&acirc;sudeva constitutes the ultimate causal essence,
of which the three others are the effects.&mdash;The believer after
having worshipped V&acirc;sudeva for a hundred years by means of
approach to the temple (abhigamana), procuring of things to be
offered (up&acirc;d&acirc;na), oblation (&icirc;jy&acirc;),
recitation of prayers, &amp;c. (sv&acirc;dhy&acirc;ya), and devout
meditation (yoga), passes beyond all affliction and reaches the
highest Being.</p>
<p>Concerning this system we remark that we do not intend to
controvert the doctrine that N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<i>n</i>a, who is
higher than the Undeveloped, who is the highest Self, and the Self
of all, reveals himself by dividing himself in multiple ways; for
various scriptural passages, such as 'He is onefold, he is
threefold' (Ch. Up. VII, 26, 2), teach us that the highest Self
appears in manifold forms. Nor do we mean to object to the
inculcation of unceasing concentration of mind on the highest Being
which appears in the Bh&acirc;gavata doctrine under the forms of
reverential approach, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page441" id=
"page441"></a>{441}</span> &amp;c.; for that we are to meditate on
the Lord we know full well from Sm<i>ri</i>ti and Scripture. We,
however, must take exception to the doctrine that
Sa@nkarsha<i>n</i>a springs from V&acirc;sudeva, Pradyumna from
Sa@nkarsha<i>n</i>a, Aniruddha from Pradyumna. It is not possible
that from V&acirc;sudeva, i.e. the highest Self, there should
originate Sa@nkarsha<i>n</i>a, i.e. the individual soul; for if
such were the case, there would attach to the soul non-permanency,
and all the other imperfections which belong to things originated.
And thence release, which consists in reaching the highest Being,
could not take place; for the effect is absorbed only by entering
into its cause.&mdash;That the soul is not an originated thing, the
teacher will prove later on (II, 3, 17). For this reason the
Bh&acirc;gavata hypothesis is unacceptable.</p>
<p>43. And (it is) not (observed that) the instrument is produced
from the agent.</p>
<p>The Bh&acirc;gavata hypothesis is to be rejected for that reason
also, that observation never shows us an instrument, such as a
hatchet and the like, to spring from an agent such as Devadatta, or
any other workman. But the Bh&acirc;gavatas teach that from an
agent, viz. the individual soul termed Sa@nkarsha<i>n</i>a, there
springs its instrument, viz. the internal organ termed Pradyumna,
and again from this offspring of the agent another instrument, viz.
the aha@nk&acirc;ra termed Aniruddha. Such doctrines cannot be
settled without observed instances. And we do not meet with any
scriptural passage in their favour.</p>
<p>44. Or (if) in consequence of the existence of knowledge,
&amp;c. (V&acirc;sudeva, &amp;c. be taken as Lords), yet there is
non-exclusion of that (i.e. the objection raised in S&ucirc;tra
42).</p>
<p>Let us then&mdash;the Bh&acirc;gavatas may say&mdash;understand
by Sa@nkarsha<i>n</i>a, and so on, not the individual soul, the
mind, &amp;c., but rather Lords, i.e. powerful beings distinguished
by all the qualities characteristic of rulers, such as pre-eminence
of knowledge and ruling capacity, strength, valour, glory.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page442" id=
"page442"></a>{442}</span> All these are V&acirc;sudevas free from
faults, without a substratum (not sprung from pradh&acirc;na),
without any imperfections. Hence the objection urged in S&ucirc;tra
42 does not apply.</p>
<p>Even on this interpretation of your doctrine, we reply, the
'non-exclusion of that,' i.e. the non-exclusion of the
impossibility of origination, can be established.&mdash;Do you, in
the first place, mean to say that the four individual Lords,
V&acirc;sudeva, and so on, have the same attributes, but do not
constitute one and the same Self?&mdash;If so, you commit the fault
of uselessly assuming more than one Lord, while all the work of the
Lord can be done by one. Moreover, you offend thereby against your
own principle, according to which there is only one real essence,
viz. the holy V&acirc;sudeva.&mdash;Or do you perhaps mean to say
that from the one highest Being there spring those four forms
possessing equal attributes?&mdash;In that case the objection urged
in S&ucirc;tra 42 remains valid. For Sa@nkarsha<i>n</i>a cannot be
produced from V&acirc;sudeva, nor Pradyumna from
Sa@nkarsha<i>n</i>a, nor Aniruddha from Pradyumna, since (the
attributes of all of them being the same) there is no supereminence
of any one of them. Observation shows that the relation of cause
and effect requires some superiority on the part of the
cause&mdash;as, for instance, in the case of the clay and the jar
(where the cause is more extensive than the effect)&mdash;and that
without such superiority the relation is simply impossible. But the
followers of the P&acirc;<i>&ntilde;k</i>ar&acirc;tra do not
acknowledge any difference founded on superiority of knowledge,
power, &amp;c. between V&acirc;sudeva and the other Lords, but
simply say that they all are forms of V&acirc;sudeva, without any
special distinctions. The forms of V&acirc;sudeva cannot properly
be limited to four, as the whole world, from Brahman down to a
blade of grass, is understood to be a manifestation of the supreme
Being.</p>
<p>45. And on account of contradictions.</p>
<p>Moreover, manifold contradictions are met with in the
Bh&acirc;gavata system, with reference to the assumption of
qualities and their bearers. Eminence of knowledge and <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page443" id="page443"></a>{443}</span> ruling
capacity, strength, valour, and glory are enumerated as qualities,
and then they are in some other place spoken of as Selfs, holy
V&acirc;sudevas, and so on.&mdash;Moreover, we meet with passages
contradictory of the Veda. The following passage, for instance,
blames the Veda, 'Not having found the highest bliss in the Vedas
<i>S</i>&acirc;<i>nd</i>ilya studied this
<i>s</i>&acirc;stra.'&mdash;For this reason also the
Bh&acirc;gavata doctrine cannot be accepted.</p>

cause of the mahattva of a ternary atomic compound, for instance,
is the tritva inherent in the three constituent atoms. In other

senses.&mdash;Touch (spar<i>s</i>a) is the sensations of cold,
warmth, &amp;c. on the embryo's part.&mdash;Feeling (vedan&aacute;)
the sensations of pleasure and pain resulting
therefrom.&mdash;Desire (t<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>&acirc;) is the wish
to enjoy the pleasurable sensations and to shun the painful
ones.&mdash;Activity (up&acirc;d&acirc;na) is the effort resulting
from desire,&mdash;Birth is the passing out from the
uterus.&mdash;Species (j&acirc;ti) is the class of beings to which
the new-born creature belongs.&mdash;Decay
(jar&acirc;).&mdash;Death (mara<i>n</i>am) is explained as the
condition of the creature when about to die
(mum&ucirc;rsh&acirc;).&mdash;Grief (<i>s</i>oka) the frustration
of wishes connected therewith.&mdash;Lament (paridevanam) the
lamentations on that account.&mdash;Pain (du<i>h</i>kha) is such
pain as caused by the five senses.&mdash;Durmanas is mental
affliction.&mdash;The 'and the like' implies death, the departure

<p>A series of momentary existences constituting a chain of causes

existence must be supposed either to produce its effect or not to
produce it. In the former case the series is continued; the latter
alternative would imply that the last link does not really exist,
since the Bauddhas define the satt&acirc; of a thing as its causal
efficiency (cp. Sarvadar<i>s</i>a<i>n</i>asa<i>m</i>graha). And the
non-existence of the last link would retrogressively lead to the
non-existence of the whole series.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
